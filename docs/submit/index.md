# Preparing your Data Package for Submission

  ![](share.drawio)

## Prepare your data package for submission by creating a "shareable data package"

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">



Once you have finished preparing your data package locally, you will need to prepare your data package for submission to a repository, by creating a "shareable data package" or packages. A shareable data package includes the subset of study files that you intend to share, while excluding study files that you do NOT intend to share. 

There are several different "flavors" or types of shareable data package that allow you to share study files in different ways (e.g. open access, managed access, right away, under embargo until a specific date, etc.), and if you want to share different sets of study files in different ways, you may want to create more than one shareable data package of different flavors to accomplish this easily.

This section will walk through the different ways you may want to share your data and why you might want to share your data in different ways, the flavors or types of shareable data packages that allow you to share in different ways, how to determine which study files should go into your shareable data package depending upon the flavor or type of your shareable data package, and how to finalize your shareable data package or packages for submission to a data repository.

If you already know what flavor of shareable data package you want to create, and whether you will create more than shareable data package, use these links to head directly to step-by-step instruction for how to create each flavor of shareable data package:

## Why you might want to share your data in different ways

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

Depending on your specific study situation, you may not want to share all your files in a public data repository regardless of how protected they may be or the timing of sharing (e.g., if you collected human subjects data, you would not want to share fully identified versions of this data publicly). Importantly, these "unshareable" study files should never be included in a shareable data package of any type.

Leaving these "unshareable" study files aside, you still may not want to share all study files in the same way or at the same time:

!!! example ""
    === "Sharing study files with different levels of protection"

        * <b>Managed Access:</b> Your study may have generated sensitive data (e.g., identified human subjects data which you subsequently deidentified, with some level of disclosure risk remaining). In this case, you may want to:
          * share the sensitive data as <u>managed access</u> 
          * while sharing study data that are not sensitive (e.g., non-human subject data) or non-data supporting files such as data dictionaries, protocols, and code as <u>open access</u>.
        * <b>Open Access:</b> Your study may have generated only non-sensitive data (e.g., non-human subjects data). In this case, you may want to:
          * share all study data and non-data supporting files such as data dictionaries, protocols, and code as <u>open access</u>.

    === "Sharing study files at different times"

        * <b>At a later date:</b> Your study group may have not yet published on the study results and/or secured any intellectual property rights applicable to the study, and you may want to wait to share until after reaching these milestones. In this case, you may want to:
          * share certain data, results, or other study documents under embargo, so that they are shared <u>at a later date</u> 
          * while perhaps sharing other study files (e.g. certain subsets of data that you will not use to publish , certain subsets of data that do not contain intellectual property, data dictionaries, protocols, and code) without an embargo, so that they are shared <u>now</u>.
        * <b>Now:</b> Your study group may have already published on the data and/or secured any intellectual property rights applicable to the study. In this case, you may want to:
          * share all study data and non-data supporting files such as data dictionaries, protocols, and code without an embargo, so that they are shared <u>now</u>.

         
How and when you want to share all or some of your study files will determine the approach you take to preparing your data package for submission, including what flavor or type of shareable data package you will create, and whether you will create more than one type of shareable data package.

## When to create more than one shareable data package

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

Depending on how and when you are sharing your data, you may want to create more than one "flavor" of shareable data package for your data. 

Situations in which you may want to create and share multiple shareable data packages of different "flavors" at your data repository include:

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

<b>You want to share some files as open access and some as managed access</b>

Because it is easiest and fastest for secondary users to get access to an open-access-now (versus managed-access-now) shareable data package, creating and sharing both an open-access-now and managed-access-now shareable data package maximizes access to your valuable study files.

Potential secondary users can access the open-access-now version right away, and this can inform their work plans as they work through the process of gaining authorization to access the managed-access-now version of the shareable data package.


<b>You want to share some files right away and others after you've published or secured intellectual property rights</b>

Because it will be faster for secondary users to get access to an open-access-now shareable data package (versus open-access-by-date, where the milestone or "by date" date, after which the files will be available for sharing, has not yet passed), creating and sharing both an open-access-now and open-access-by-date shareable data package will allow researchers to access some of your data and supporting files now, maximizing access to your valuable study files

## Creating your shareable data package(s)

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">


Creating a shareable data package largely consists of starting with your local data package and filtering in study files you've indicated you want to share and filtering out study files you've indicated you do not want to share.

* The Resource Tracker and Experiment Tracker should be included by default in any shareable data package created.
* Results Tracker(s) and Data Dictionary(ies) will only be included in a shareable data package if they are listed in the Resource Tracker as shareable

Once the shareable data package has been reviewed and approved by the study PI or other appropriate study staff, the shareable data package should be zipped up into a zip archive. The full shareable data package submitted to a public repository will include:
* Zipped data package
* An edited version of your study's Resource Tracker, which designates which files are included in the zipped data package
* A README

Finally, once the full shareable data package is complete, it can be submitted to the data repository selected by the study group.

### First steps to creating a shareable data package

Before you can begin creating your shareable data package, you should make sure your data and metadata are organized and annotated appropriately to facilitate this process.

#### Using standard data package metadata

If you have set up your local data package by adding standard data package metadata (including a resource tracker), **you have already specified which files you will share as well as how and when you will share them** using the "access" and "access date" fields in the Resource Tracker.

!!! info "Key shareable data package fields"
    === "Access"

        See the table below for an refresher on the "access" fields:

        | Field    | Description                 |
        | ----------------| ----------------------------|
        | **open access** | Share with very low barrier to access |
        | **managed access** | Share with relatively high barrier to access, managed either by<br>repository staff or by study staff depending on the repository |
        | **temporary private** | Share after the access date specified |
        | **permanent private** | Do not share |

    === "Access date"

        Access date field is a date value that specifies when a file should be shared.

        This field will only be used if the file to be shared is currently marked as temporary private.


#### Ensuring your study files are shareable

For a file to be considered shareable, each of the following must be true:

1. The file is listed as a resource in the Resource Tracker
2. The access field for that resource is complete
3. If the access field value is temporary private, 1) the access date (which specifies when the file will become shareable) is complete, and 2) there is a second value in "access" of either open or managed access (the way you want to share a file once it is no longer temporary private)

Check that all of the appropriate files are annotated and fields are complete before starting to prepare your data package for submission.
