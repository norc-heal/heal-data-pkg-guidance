# Preparing your Data Package for Submission

Once you have fiished preparing your data package locally, you will need to prepare your data package for submission to a repository.

!!! note

    This process will work best if all of your study files are saved in a centralized study folder.

## Think about what type of shareable data package you want to submit
You should start by thinking about what sorts of shareable data packages you want to produce. You likely have some files designated as open access and some managed access. Other files may be embargoed until a certain date, at which point they will become open or managed access. You may also have some files that are permanent private, which you will not be sharing. This step will help you determine which files will go into your final shareable data package(s) and how to create them.

### Why create more than one shareable data package?
Depending on how and when you are sharing, you may want to create more than one version of a shareable data package for your data. Some examples of what this might look like include:

**Example 1**: You have some open-access and some managed-access files, you may want to create two shareable data packages:

* ***'Open-access' shareable data package***: containing only files designated as open-access
* ***'Managed-access' shareable data package***: containing files designated as managed-access, as well as open-access files

**Example 2**: All of your files will be open-access, but some of these files are designated as temporary-private until a certain date (due to embargo), you may want to create two shareable data packages:

* ***'Open-access now' shareable data package***: containing only files designated as open-access as of the current date
* ***'Open-access after embargo date' shareable data package***: containing all files designated as open-access on or after a designated date

After you decide what types of shareable data packages you would like to create for repository submission, see below for instructions on how to create different types of shareable data packages.
