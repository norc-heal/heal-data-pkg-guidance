## Resource Tracker fields critical for creating your shareable data package

If you have created your local data package by adding standard data package metadata (including a Resource Tracker) to your study files, **you have already specified which files you will share as well as how and when you will share them** using the "access" and "access date" fields in the Resource Tracker.

    === "Access"

        See the table below for an refresher on the "access" field allowed values:

        | Field values    | Description                 |
        | ----------------| ----------------------------|
        | **open access** | Share with very low barrier to access |
        | **managed access** | Share with relatively high barrier to access, managed either by<br>repository staff or by study staff depending on the repository |
        | **temporary private** | Share after the access date specified |
        | **permanent private** | Do not share |

    === "Access date"

        Access date field is a date value that specifies when a file should be shared.

        This field will only be used if the file to be shared is marked as temporary private.
