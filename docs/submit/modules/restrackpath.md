<!-- File path updates for Resource and Results Trackers -->

Next, you will need to make adjustments to your Resource Tracker and Results Tracker(s) that you copied into your shareable data package folder from full paths to paths relative to the dsc-pkg folder.

* Adjusting the paths within these trackers to be relative to the dsc-pkg folder protects your study team's privacy, as it means people won't see your local folder structure, while also increasing utility for secondary users.
* As mentioned previously, this method works best when all files and the dsc-pkg folder are saved within a centralized study folder. Every path disclosed will be in relation to your dsc-pkg folder and within your centralized study folder.

See below for information on adjustments to make within each tracker. ***Reminder:** You will be making these adjustments the Resource Tracker and Results Tracker(s) within your shareable data package folder, not your dsc-pkg folder.*
