<!-- open access date intro -->

#### Create your 'open-access-by-date' shareable data package folder

* Within the my-study-share folder, create a new folder - this will be your shareable data package folder. A name suggestion and convention that we will use here is to call it "my-study-share-open-access-by-[YYYY-MM-DD]". You should replace [YYYY-MM-DD] with the milestone date after which you intend to share the files that will be shared in this shareable data package - i.e. the date after which any embargo on sharing these files will expire. (*Note: In the instructions that follow, this folder will be referred to as your "shareable data package folder"*)
* If your local data package or my-study folder has sub-folders (it will have at least one - i.e., the dsc-pkg folder containing your standard data package metadata) - create sub-folders within your shareable data package folder that reflect the same structure as your local data package or my-study folder. **All folders you create here should be empty right now.**
  * This is the structure into which you will copy in the files from your local data package or my-study folder once you have determined which files are meant to be shared in your shareable data package folder. For more information on how to decide which files will be copied into this folder, move to the next section.
  * Mirroring the structure of your local data package or my-study folder in your shareable data package folder will allow a secondary user to easily find files referenced in the Resource Tracker by their provided relative file path.
