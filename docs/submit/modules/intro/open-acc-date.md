<!-- open access date intro -->

#### Create your 'open-access-by-date' shareable data package folder

* Within that folder, create another folder called "my-study-share-open-access-by-[YYYY-MM-DD]." You should replace [YYYY-MM-DD] with the intended date when you will share your data package at a repository.  This is where your data package will live. (*Note: In the instructions that follow, this folder will be referred to as your "shareable data package folder."*)
  * In creating your "my-study-share-open-access-by-date" folder, you will want to mirror the folder structure of your current internal centralized study folder where all your files and supporting documentation are held. **All folders you create here should be empty right now.**
    * Mirroring the structure of your centralized study folder will allow a secondary user to find files referenced in the Resource Tracker in the folder based on their provided file path.
    * This is where you will copy in the files from your centralized study folder that are meant to be shared in your "open-access-by-date" shareable data package. For more information on how to decide which files will be copied into this folder, move to the next section.
