* Within that folder, create another folder called "my-study-share-managed-access-by-date." You should replace "date" with the intended date when you will share your data package at a repository. This is where your data package will live.
  * In this folder, you will want to mirror the folder structure of your current internal centralized study folder where all your files and supporting documentation are held. **All folders you create here should be empty right now.**
    * Mirroring the structure of your centralized study folder will allow a secondary user to find files referenced in the Resource Tracker in the folder based on their provided file path.
    * This is where you will copy in the files from your centralized study folder that are meant to be shared in your "managed-access by date" shareable data package. Continue to the next step for more information on this.
