#### Create your 'open-access-now' shareable data package folder

* Within the my-study-share folder, create your shareable data package folder. A name suggestion and convention that we will use here is calling it "my-study-share-open-access-now." This is will be your 'open-access-now' shareable data package. (*Note: In the instructions that follow, this folder will be referred to as either your "shareable data package folder" or "my-study-share-open-access-now" folder*)
  * If your my-study folder has sub-folders - it will have at least one (i.e., the dsc-pkg folder) - create sub-folders within your shareable data package folder that reflect the same structure as your my-study folder. **All folders you create here should be empty right now.**
    * Mirroring the structure of your my-study folder will allow a secondary user to find files referenced in the Resource Tracker in the folder based on their provided file path.
    * This is where you will copy in the files from your my-study folder that are meant to be shared in your shareable data package folder. For more information on how to decide which files will be copied into this folder, move to the next section.
