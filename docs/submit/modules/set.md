#### Set yourself up for success

Before you begin, you should review a few things to ensure you are ready to prepare your data package for submission. 

1. Review the contents of your study folder. Ensure that all study files, your dsc-pkg folder, and standard data package metadata are saved within your centralized study folder. Your study folder may look something like this:

2. Review your resource tracker, experiment tracker, and results tracker(s) to ensure that you have annotated all resources that you are planning to share in a repository. Also confirm that:
  1. All "access" and "access-date" fields are filled out completely and in accordance with your plan on how and when to share each resource. Accuracy of these fields will be essential for creating your shareable data package.
  2. Your Results Tracker(s) have been added to your Resource Tracker as resource(s) in addition to adding them as associated Results Tracker(s) when documenting the manuscript to which they correspond as a resource.

3. If your study folder looks complete and all resources have been annotated, then you are ready to move to creating shareable data package(s).

4. Create another directory in the parent directory where your my-study folder currently lives. This folder will hold all shareable data package(s) you create, plus accessory files (i.e., an overview Resource Tracker and a README).
