You will need to create a folder to hold all data and non-data supporting files that you have designated as shareable from your study. You can create your folder however you see fit, but a recommended structure follow below. The following instructions will refer to recommended folder names throughout.

* Create a folder called "my-study-share-current date." (*Note: You can name this folder whatever you would like - this is just a recommended name.*)
  * This folder will hold your shareable data package as well as some supporting documentation.
