<!-- zip up shareable data package -->

1. After you have edited your Resource Tracker to reflect relative file paths, you will need to make another copy. This copy should be moved into your one-level-up "my-study-share-current date" directory. You will add some additional information to this version of the Resource Tracker in the coming steps. This version of the Resource Tracker will act as supporting documentation for your zipped shareable data package.
2. Examine your shareable data package folder to ensure that you have shared the files and resources you want to share and have not shared anything you don't want to share.
3. Now, your shareable data package folder is ready to zip up for submission. 
  1. You can zip it up in whichever way you choose.
