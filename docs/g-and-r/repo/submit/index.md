# Repository Submission

After selecting a repository, you should familiarize yourself with its specific submission requirements and any guidance the repository provides for submitters. Some repository submission requirements may be more prescriptive than others, depending on aspects of the studies accepted, such as the type of data, and level of access controls.

**Use case: Submission to Sequence Read Archive (SRA)**: [This step-by-step guide](srasubmit.md) presents a use case walking through the submission process for RNA-seq data at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA).

For information on submission requirements for other repositories, refer to your selected repository's website.
