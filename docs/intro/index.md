**WHAT IS A DATA PACKAGE?**

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

A data package is made up of your study files and the Standard Data Package Metadata, a set of metadata files that describe your study, study files and results, and study file and results relationships. 

* Add the Standard Data Package Metadata to your study files, wherever your study files naturally reside.

**WHY SHOULD I CREATE A DATA PACKAGE?**

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

Creating a data package facilitates the creation of a [shareable data package](shareable.md) that can be directly submitted to a repository, **fulfilling your HEAL data sharing requirements**.

Creating a data package also has additional great benefits, including:
  
* Results in a better product shared at a repository
* The organization of a data package makes work within your own team more efficient and reproducible
* Facilitates internal and external understanding, as well as collaboration and data re-use opportunities

</div>

**WHERE SHOULD I CREATE MY DATA PACKAGE?** 

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

At the same local or network drive where your study files naturally reside.

* If your study files are naturally centralized in a single overall "study folder," add Standard Data Package Metadata as a subdirectory of your study folder.
