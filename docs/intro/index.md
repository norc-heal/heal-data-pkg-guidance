**WHAT IS A DATA PACKAGE?**

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

A data package is the combination of your [study files](study-file.md) and [Standard Data Package Metadata](sdpmd.md), which is a set of structured metadata files that describe your study, study files and results, and study file and result relationships. 

The addition of Standard Data Package Metadata to your study files provides critical context for your study files and results within your own research team (allowing for efficient intra-team communication, coordination, and replication), and to potential secondary users of the valuable data and results you've collected and created.   

* Add the Standard Data Package Metadata to your study files, wherever your study files naturally reside.

**WHY SHOULD I CREATE A DATA PACKAGE?**

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

Creating a data package facilitates the creation of a [shareable data package](shareable.md) that 1) contains only study files you intend to share, 2) contains sufficient context for secondary users to understand and use the files you share, and replicate your study results, and 3) can be directly submitted to a repository, **fulfilling your HEAL data sharing requirements**.

Creating a data package also has additional great benefits, including:
  
* Results in a better product shared at a repository
* The organization of a data package makes work within your own team more efficient and reproducible
* Facilitates internal and external understanding, as well as collaboration and data re-use opportunities

**WHERE SHOULD I CREATE MY DATA PACKAGE?** 

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

At the same local or network drive where your study files naturally reside.

* If your study files are naturally centralized in a single overall "study folder," add Standard Data Package Metadata as a subdirectory of your study folder.
