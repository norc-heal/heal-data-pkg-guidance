# Basics of Data Packaging for HEAL-Funded Investigators
  
  ![](intro.drawio)

**WHAT IS A DATA PACKAGE?**

A data package is made up of your study files and the Standard Data Package Metadata, a set of metadata files that describe your study, study files and results, and study file and results relationships. 

* Add the Standard Data Package Metadata to your study files, wherever your study files naturally reside.

**WHY SHOULD I CREATE A DATA PACKAGE?**

Creating a data package facilitates the creation of a shareable data package that can be directly submitted to a repository, **fulfilling your HEAL data sharing requirements**.

Creating a data package also has additional great benefits, including:
  
* Results in a better product shared at a repository
* The organization of a data package makes work within your own team more efficient and reproducible
* Facilitates internal and external understanding, as well as collaboration and data re-use opportunities


**WHERE SHOULD I CREATE MY DATA PACKAGE?** 

At the same local or network drive where your study files naturally reside.

* If your study files are naturally centralized in a single overall "study folder," add Standard Data Package Metadata as a subdirectory of your study folder.

## Study Files

**WHAT ARE STUDY FILES?**

Files naturally related to or resulting from your study as youd design, implement, and complete your study, and share your study results, all in their native format and location.

**WHERE ARE STUDY FILES STORED?**

Your "working" study folder, wherever you naturally save files related to your study as you design, implement, and complete yours tudy, and publish your study results.

* Ideally this would be in a single, centralized overall "my study" study folder, but the process works even if files are decentralized.

## Standard Data Package Metadata Files

![](metadata.drawio)

**WHAT ARE STANDARD DATA PACKAGE METADATA?**

* Structured metadata files that, altogether, describe your study, study files and results, and study file and result relationships
* This metadata provides the essential sharing, usability, and contextual information that allows understanding and re-use across research communities
* These files include:

  * Study overview
  * Experiment tracker
  * Resource tracker
  * Data dictionaries
  * Results tracker(s)

**HOW DO I CREATE STANDARD DATA PACKAGE METADATA?**

Templates and schemas/field definitions to aid you in completing the Standard Data Package Metadata templates are available for all Standard Data Package Metadata.

## Creating a Shareable Data Package

**WHAT IS A SHAREABLE DATA PACKAGE?**

* Zip archive produced locally, to be submitted to a repository
* Includes only files to be shared to a repository
* More than one 'flavor' possible depending on how and when files are designated to be shared: open-access, managed-access, embargo through a specific date, etc.
