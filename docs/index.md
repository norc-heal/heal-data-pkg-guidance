A data package is an archive containing research data together with the metadata,
supporting files and documentation needed to permit someone unconnected to the original 
study to discover, understand, replicate, and/or (re)use the data or other study materials
(e.g. code, protocol, survey instrument) for a specific purpose.

This guide aims to provide **clear, step-by-step instructions** for how to:

1. Create a *data package*
2. Prepare a *data package* for submission to a public data repository

Creating a data package inherently makes the originating study group's job of preparing the data package for submission to a
public data repository easier!

## Benefit for Secondary Users

The focus here is on creating data packages suitable for submission to a public data repository to permit replication of a previous analysis and/or secondary analyses. 

Such packages include the information necessary to make
the data *findable*, *accessible*, *interoperable* and *reusable*
([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)). In particular, they (1)
include metadata that may be indexed and searched to permit researchers to
find the data; (2) organize and store data and supporting files using common,
open standards and formats that make them easy to use; and (3) include
sufficient documentation, including information on provenance and data use
requirements and restrictions, to permit researchers to understand and reuse the data.

## Benefit for Originating study group & <br>Data Packages without data

Importantly, while data packages are the best way to share primary research
data with potential secondary users, *they are also useful for the originating 
study group* AND *they are also useful even when the originating study group is 
generating data that cannot be shared or is working with secondary data that cannot 
be redistributed*. 

A data package provides an ideal way to organize your work locally, increasing
the efficiency and reproducibility of your own work and facilitating
collaboration among your team. In addition, a data package may be easily
modified to exclude all or some of the data themselves—possibly replacing them with links to
their sources in the case of secondary data or with synthetic data—leaving you
with a product that can then be shared in order to document your work and
permit other researchers to replicate your analysis.

## Navigating this guide

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

The material in this guide is organized into four main sections. 

The first section provides
[a general overview](overview/what) of data packages, including what they are,
why they're useful, and when and how to make one. 

The second section is a
[step-by-step tutorial](fit) on creating your first data package, with
instructions tailored to your own situation based on your answers to three
simple questions. 

The third section is a
[step-by-step tutorial](submit) on preparing your first data package for submission to a public data repository, with
instructions tailored to your own situation based on your answers to three
simple questions.

The fourth section provides [additional guidance](g-and-r) on
specific topics as well as references to additional resources that may be
helpful. Links to specific parts of this last section are provided throughout the 
first three sections to clarify concepts and recommendations as they come up.
