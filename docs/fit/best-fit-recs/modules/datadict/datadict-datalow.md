<!-- Dataset sharing early low and late both -->

* If the dataset-of-interest, or any associated file/dependency of the dataset-of-interest is a [tabular data file](../../terms/index.md#tabular-data-file), create a [Data Dictionary](../../terms/index.md#data-dictionary) for the tabular dataset-of-interest and for each associated file/dependency that is a tabular data file, AND add these Data Dictionaries to the list of associated files/dependencies for the dataset-of-interest
  * Start a Data Dictionary for a tabular data file by initializing an empty Data Dictionary file based on the [Data Dictionary csv template](../../csv-templates/heal-csv-data-dictionary.csv)
    * Save your Data Dictionary in your ["dsc-pkg" folder](../../terms/index.md#dsc-pkg-folder) as "heal-csv-dd-my-datafile.csv" (i.e. the file name starts with the prefix "heal-csv-dd-", you append the name of the data file to which the Data Dictionary applies, and save as a csv file)
    * Add all variables in the tabular data file to your Data Dictionary
      * Use the [Data Dictionary schema](../../schemas/md_data_dictionary.md) to understand what each "question"/field in the Data Dictionary means and how to "answer"/complete each "question"/field
