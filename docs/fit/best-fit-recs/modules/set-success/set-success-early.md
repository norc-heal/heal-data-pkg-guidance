#### Set yourself up for success

* Review all [study files/resources](../../terms/index.md#study-filesresources) already produced by or for your study
* Come up with file organization and naming conventions for your study folders and files now - Consider applying [HEAL recommendations for file organization and naming](../../file-o-and-n/index.md). Apply these conventions to existing study files and to any future files and folders as they are created
* Where practicable to implement (without duplicating original files), organize all study files/resources into a single study folder/directory (study folder/directory may of course have sub-directories; see [here](../../guidance/file-org.md) for guidance on and examples of recommended study folder/directory structure)
* All [study files/resources](../../terms/index.md#study-filesresources) should be stored in a location where the person(s) who will be creating/contributing to your data package documentation can access them all at the same time (e.g. you can have files located on different network drives as long as all network drives can be mounted and accessed at the same time by the person documenting; you CANNOT have files located on two different local computer drives, even if the person documenting can access both computers separately)

!!! warning "A note on copying study files"

    Although these guidelines provide suggestions on useful adjustments you can make before you start documenting that will make documentation easier (e.g., applying naming conventions and ensuring files are accessible to the person documenting), these guidelines **do not** mean that you should copy your study files into new or existing folders to group all "to share" files together. 
    
    **All documentation should be completed based on original files.** Creating copies of your files for documentation can introduce inconsistencies in your final package (e.g., if you edit the original file but not the copy, the file documented and likely shared will not be the most up to date version). 
    
    **The only exception to this rule**: After you have completely finished documenting your study files at their local (or network) paths, you will copy the files that you intend to share to finish [preparing your data package for submission](../../../../submit/index.md).
