#### Set yourself up for success
* Review all [study files/resources](../../terms/index.md#study-filesresources) already produced by or for your study
  * If you are late in your study, you've likely accumulated many study files already. This means establishing file naming and organization conventions now and back-applying them may be quite burdensome and potentially prone to error. Therefore, we generally recommend that you leave file names and organization as is - However, we do request that you consider the following exceptions: 
    * Where practicable to implement (without duplicating original files), organize all study files/resources into a single study folder/directory (study folder/directory may of course have sub-directories; see [here](../../guidance/file-org.md) for guidance on and examples of recommended study folder/directory structure) 
    * If you have sets of "like" files (e.g. a similarly formatted tabular data file or brain imaging file per study subject per study timepoint), it may be well worth establishing file naming and organization conventions based on [HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources](../../file-o-and-n/index.md) now and back-applying them just for these file sets - doing so may make it possible/easier to annotate these file sets in one go instead of annotating them singly one at a time, and so may substantially reduce annotation/data-sharing burden for the study group
* All [study files/resources](../../terms/index.md#study-filesresources) should be stored in a location where the person(s)  who will be creating/contributing to your data package documentation can access them all at the same time (e.g. you can have files located on different network drives as long as all network drives can be mounted and accessed at the same time by the person documenting; you CANNOT have files located on two different local computer drives, even if the person documenting can access both computers separately)

!!! warning "A note on copying study files"

    Although these guidelines provide suggestions on some useful adjustments you can make before you start documenting that will make documentation easier (e.g., applying naming conventions and ensuring files are accessible to the person documenting), these guidelines **do not** mean that you should copy your study files into new or existing folders to group all "to share" files together. 
    
    **All documentation should be completed based on original files.** Creating copies of your files for documentation can introduce inconsistencies in your final package (e.g., if you edit the original file but not the copy, the file documented and likely shared will not be the most up to date version). 
    
    **The only exception to this rule**: After you have completely finished documenting your study files at their local (or network) paths, you will copy the files that you intend to share to finish [preparing your data package for submission](../../submit/index.md).
