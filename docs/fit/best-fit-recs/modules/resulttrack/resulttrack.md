* Start your Results Tracker by initializing an empty Results Tracker file based on the [Results Tracker csv template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/norc-heal/heal-data-pkg-tool/main/heal-csv-results-tracker.csv)
  * Save your Results Tracker in your ["dsc-pkg" folder](../../terms/index.md#dsc-pkg-folder) as "heal-csv-results-tracker.csv"
  * Each row in your Results Tracker will represent a single result
  * Use the [Results Tracker schema](../../schemas/md_results_tracker.md) to understand what each "question"/field in the Results Tracker means and how to "answer"/complete each "question"/field  
  * The Results Tracker will ask you to list [associated files/dependencies](../../terms/index.md#associated-filesdependencies) for each study result shared in the manuscript (i.e. files that are required to interpret, replicate, or use the result)
* Add all study results shared in your manuscript to your Results Tracker
