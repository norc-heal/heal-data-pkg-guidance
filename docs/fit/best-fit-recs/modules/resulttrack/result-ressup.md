<!-- All results suport -->
* Start to create a Results Tracker to document the [results](../../terms/index.md#final-result-products) (e.g. figures, tables) that will be published as part of your manuscript or report
* Start your Results Tracker by initializing an empty Results Tracker file based on the [Results Tracker csv template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/norc-heal/heal-data-pkg-tool/main/heal-csv-results-tracker.csv){:target="_blank"} 
  * Save your Results Tracker in your ["dsc-pkg" folder](../../terms/index.md#dsc-pkg-folder) as "heal-csv-results-tracker-my-manuscript-file.csv" (i.e. the file name starts with the prefix "heal-csv-results-tracker-", you append the name of the manuscript or report to which the Results Tracker applies, and save as a csv file)
* Add all results shared in the manuscript or report to the manuscript's Results Tracker
  * Use the [Results Tracker schema](../../schemas/md_results_tracker.md) to understand what each "question"/field in the Results Tracker means and how to "answer"/complete each "question"/field 
  * The Results Tracker will ask you to list [associated files/dependencies](../../terms/index.md#associated-filesdependencies) for each result (i.e. files that are required to interpret, replicate, or use the result)
