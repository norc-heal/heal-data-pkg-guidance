**Congratulations! You have finished preparing your data package locally.**

You can now [prepare your data package for submission](../../submit/index.md) to a public repository.

!!! tip "Tip to confirm your local data package is ready for submission"

    Before you share your data package, it may be useful to ask someone else in your study group to review your data package and annotations thinking about whether it would be accessible and understandable to a researcher looking at the data package for the first time. 
    
    If they are able to easily understand the study structure and how they might go about replicating your dataset/results, that is a good sign that your data package has the necessary resources and adequate detail to be shared.
