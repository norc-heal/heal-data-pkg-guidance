* First, add your manuscript and its associated Results Tracker to your Resource Tracker.
* For each shared result in your Results Tracker, add any items you have listed as associated files/dependencies as resources to your Resource Tracker **ONLY if that file will be shared in a public repository**.
  * Remember that whenever you add a tabular data file to your Resource Tracker, you should first create a data dictionary. Then, add the tabular file to the Resource Tracker and list the data dictionary you have created as a dependency.
* Finally, add as a resource any file that has been added as an associated files/dependency of a resource in the Resource Tracker **AND that will be shared in a public repository**.
