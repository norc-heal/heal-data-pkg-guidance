<!-- Late results support standard, low; early results support low-->

* First, add your manuscript and its associated Results Tracker to your Resource Tracker.
* For each shared result in your Results Tracker, add any items you have listed as associated files/dependencies as resources to your Resource Tracker **ONLY if that file will be shared in a public repository**.
  * Remember that whenever you add a tabular data file to your Resource Tracker, you should first create a data dictionary. Then, add the tabular file to the Resource Tracker and list the data dictionary you have created as a dependency.
* Finally, any file that has been added as an associated files/dependency of a resource in the Resource Tracker should also be added as a resource **ONLY if it will be shared in a public repository**. 
  * Repeat this process with the associated files/dependencies of these files until you're listing files without any dependencies.
* If there are any other study files that you will share in a public repository that have not already been added to the Resource Tracker, add them to the Resource Tracker now
