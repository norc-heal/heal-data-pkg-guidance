* First, add your manuscript and its associated Results Tracker to your Resource Tracker.
* For each shared result in your Results Tracker, add any items you have listed as associated files/dependencies as resources to your Resource Tracker.
  * Remember that whenever you add a tabular data file to your Resource Tracker, you should: 1) First, create a Data Dictionary for that tabular data file, and 2) then, add the tabular file to the Resource Tracker and list the data dictionary you have created as an associated file/dependency of the tabular data file.
* Finally, any file that has been added as an associated files/dependency of a resource in the Resource Tracker should also be added as a resource. 
  * Repeat this process with the associated files/dependencies of these files until you're listing files without any dependencies.
