<!--General resource tracker language -->

* Start your Resource Tracker by initializing an empty Resource Tracker file based on the [Resource Tracker csv template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/norc-heal/heal-data-pkg-tool/main/heal-csv-resource-tracker.csv)
  * Save your Resource Tracker in your ["dsc-pkg" folder](../../terms/index.md#dsc-pkg-folder) as "heal-csv-resource-tracker.csv"
* Add all files already produced by/for your study to your Resource Tracker
  * Use the [Resource Tracker schema](../../schemas/md_resource_tracker.md) to understand what each "question"/field in the Resource Tracker means and how to "answer"/complete each "question"/field  
  * The Resource Tracker will ask you to list [associated files/dependencies](../../terms/index.md#associated-filesdependencies) for each study file/resource (i.e. files that are required to interpret, replicate, or use the study file/resource; for tabular data files, this will include a data dictionary for the file)
