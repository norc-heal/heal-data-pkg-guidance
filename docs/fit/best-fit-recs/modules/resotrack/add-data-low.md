* First, add your finalized dataset-of-interest to your Resource Tracker.
  * If the finalized dataset-of-interest is a tabular data file, include the data dictionary as one of the dependencies of this resource.
* Next, add all associated files/dependencies for the finalized dataset-of-interest to the Resource Tracker. 
For each shared result in your Results Tracker, add any items you have listed as associated files/dependencies as resources to your Resource Tracker **ONLY if the file will be shared in a public repository**.
  * Remember that whenever you add a tabular data file to your Resource Tracker, you should first create a data dictionary. Then, add the tabular file to the Resource Tracker and list the data dictionary you have created as a dependency.
* Finally, add as a resource any file that has been added as an associated files/dependency of a resource in the Resource Tracker **AND that will be shared in a public repository**.
