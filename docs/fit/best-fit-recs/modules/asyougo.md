#### New study experiments/activities:
* Add new study experiments/activities to your [Experiment Tracker](../../terms/index.md#experiment-tracker) as they are designed (as soon as possible)
#### New tabular data files:
* Create a [Data Dictionary](../../terms/index.md#data-dictionary) for new tabular data files as they are produced
#### New study files/resources: 
* Consistently apply the file organization and naming conventions you decided on for your study files (in the "Set yourself up for Success" section) to file organization and naming as you create/collect new study files
* If you need to come up with new file organization and naming conventions for new data types, study experiments/activities, or other unanticipated file collection, consider applying [HEAL recommendations for file organization and naming](../../file-o-and-n/index.md) when proactively deciding upon those new file organization and naming conventions, and apply these conventions to study files/resources moving forward, as they are created
* Add new study files/resources to your [Resource Tracker](../../terms/index.md#resource-tracker) as they are created/collected (as soon as possible), including data and non-data support files, such as protocols, data dictionaries, code, and analysis files
