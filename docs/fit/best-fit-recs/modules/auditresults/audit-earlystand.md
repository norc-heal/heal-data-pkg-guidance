* Audit the [final result products](../../terms/index.md#final-result-products) (e.g. figure, figure panel, table, text statement) produced by your study that are shared in the manuscript - create a list of final result products
* For each final result product shared in your manuscript, 
  * Audit the full set of [associated files/dependencies](../../terms/index.md#associated-filesdependencies) for that final result product (i.e. all study files/resources required to interpret, replicate, or use the final result product)
  * Audit the full set of study experiments/activities that produced supporting data or other support for that final result product
* Check that all study experiments/activities that produced supporting data or other support for a final result product shared in your manuscript are also listed as experiments in your Experiment Tracker - Add any that are missing
