<!-- ## Early standard (results and dataset) -->
* Start your Experiment Tracker by initializing an empty Experiment Tracker file based on the [Experiment Tracker csv template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/norc-heal/heal-data-pkg-tool/main/heal-csv-experiment-tracker.csv)
  * Save your Experiment Tracker in your ["dsc-pkg" folder](../../terms/index.md#dsc-pkg-folder) as "heal-csv-experiment-tracker.csv"
  * Each row in your Experiment Tracker will represent a study experiment/activity 
  * Use the [Experiment Tracker schema](../../schemas/md_experiment_tracker.md) to understand what each "question"/field in the Experiment Tracker means and how to "answer"/complete each "question"/field
* Add all study experiments/activities which have already been designed to your Experiment Tracker
