# Initialize Your Data Package module

## Initialize Your Data Package 
* Create a ["dsc-pkg" folder/directory](../../../terms/index.md#dsc-pkg-folder) that will hold all [Standard Data Package Metadata Files](../../../terms/index.md#standard-data-package-metadata-files) for your data package
  * If all [study files/resources](../../../terms/index.md#study-filesresources) are organized into a single study folder/directory, create this folder/directory as a direct sub-directory of your study folder/directory, and name it "dsc-pkg"; consistency in naming and location of this folder/directory relative to your overall study folder/directory will make it easy to recognize as the folder that contains the Standard Data Package Metadata files for your study's data package
  * If not, create this folder/directory in a disk location that makes sense for you; name it "dsc-pkg", optionally appending a suffix to the name that will make it easy to recognize as "belonging" to a specific study (e.g. "dsc-pkg-study-1" or "dsc-pkg-mindfulness-for-oud"); consistency in naming (i.e. including the "dsc-pkg" prefix) and appending a suffix to the name that is a human-recongnizable identifier for the relevant study will make it easy to recognize as the folder that contains the Standard Data Package Metadata files for your study's data package
