* Audit all [study files/resources](../terms/index.md#study-filesresources) already produced by or for your study
  * Consider applying [HEAL recommendations for file organization and naming](../file-o-and-n/index.md) to these files now, and to future files as they are created
  * Where practicable to implement (without duplicating original files), organize all study files/resources into a single study folder/directory (study folder/directory may of course have sub-directories; see [here](../guidance/file-org.md) for guidance on and examples of recommended study folder/directory structure)
