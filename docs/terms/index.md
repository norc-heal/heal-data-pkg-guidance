# Terms and Concepts

## Tabular data file

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

A data file that is organized in a table with rows and columns.

</div>

## Study files/resources

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

All data and non-data supporting files/documents/resources generated by or for or otherwise associated with your study, regardless of whether you are planning to share them. Also known as: study resources, study files, study documents, study artefacts. 

**NOTE:** For most studies, study resources will all be files. However for some studies, this may also include (for example) bio samples or other non-file items.

</div>

## Associated Files/Dependencies

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

The term **Associated Files/Dependencies** may be used with respect to a **Resource** (i.e. [study file/resource](#study-filesresources)) or with respect to a **Result** (i.e. [results](#results)).

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

**Resource**

* When adding a study file/resource to your study's [Resource Tracker](#resource-tracker), you will be asked to supply Associated Files/Dependencies for that study file/resource. 

* An Associated File/Dependency, is any file that the current study file/resource depends on to be interpreted, replicated, or used. 

* For example, consider a processed [tabular data file](#tabular-data-file) (e.g. a final analytic dataset): 


  * A **raw data file(s)**, plus a **code file** that merges and cleans the raw data file(s) may be required to replicate the processed tabular data file, and 
  * A **data dictionary** for the processed tabular data file is likely to be required to interpret/use the processed tabular data file.

* When documenting associated files/dependencies of a resource, only list the files **directly** underlying or associated with the resource.
  * You will then document each of these associated files/dependencies as resources, only listing the files **directly** underlying or associated with the resource as associated files/dependencies.
    * Continue documenting in this "stepping backward" process until the fields you are listing as associated files/dependencies have no direct associated files/dependencies themselves.

!!! note
    * Data dictionaries and protocols should be shared in the more specific [Associated Data Dictionary](#associated-data-dictionary), [Associated Protocol](#associated-protocol) fields in the Resource Tracker wherever possible
    * When adding a publication or report to the Resource Tracker, the only dependency should be the Results Tracker for the publication, and the associated Results Tracker for the publication should be added in the more specific [Associated Results Tracker](#associated-results-tracker) field in the Resource Tracker wherever possible

</div>

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

**Result**

* When adding a result to your study's [Results Tracker](#results-tracker), you will be asked to supply Associated Files/Dependencies for that result. 

* An Associated File/Dependency, is any file that the current result depends on to be interpreted, replicated, or used. 

* For example, consider a figure that has been created as a potential candidate for inclusion as Figure 1A (in the context of a Figure 1 with panels A, B, and C) in a draft manuscript: 


  * A **png or jpg image file** exported from Corel Draw or Illustrator may directly underly the whole of Figure 1 (where image files for panel A, B, and C were formatted into a single Figure 1 in the context of a **Corel Draw or Illustrator file**);
  * A **png or jpg image file** produced and written to file by R or python code may directly underly specifically Figure 1A; 
  * This image file in turn depends upon the **code file** that produced it, as well as the **data file(s)** the code file read in and operated upon to create the final image file; 
  * The code file may have been created to implement a specific statistical analysis plan that is laid out in a larger **study protocol file**, or in a **statistical analysis plan file**; 
  * The data in the data file may have been collected using a protocol laid out in a specific **protocol file**, and if the data file(s) underlying the result in 1A is/are tabular data file(s), a **data dictionary** for the data file(s) is likely to be required to interpret/use the data file(s)

* When listing Associated Files/Dependencies for a result in the Results Tracker, including only the Associated Files/Dependencies **directly** underlying the result.
  * In the above example, that would mean documenting only the png or jpg image file underlying Figure 1.
  * You would then document the png or jpg image file as a resource in the Resource Tracker, including only the associated files/dependencies **directly** underlying the resource (i.e., png or jpg image file underlying Figure 1A, specifically).
    * Continue this "stepping backwards" process documenting resources in the Resource Tracker until the files you are listing as associated files/dependencies have no direct associated files/dependencies themselves.

## dsc-pkg Folder

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

A file folder/directory that will hold all of the [Standard Data Package Metadata Files](#standard-data-package-metadata-files) for your [Data Package](#data-package). It is generally recommended that you create a single overarching study file folder/directory to hold all study files and folders and that you create your dsc-pkg folder as a direct sub-directory of your study folder and name it "dsc-pkg". 

</div>

## Standard data package metadata files

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

Standard metadata file types that, altogether, provide essential usability and context information about the study as a whole and about the data files your study has produced/collected. These metadata files should be included in all [data packages](#data-package). They should be stored together in a single file directory, preferably as a sub-directory within your study file directory called "dsc-pkg". See below for an example directory structure. 

**NOTE**: All standard data package metadata files have a standardized csv format in which they should be completed and provided. See here for [csv templates](../schemas/index.md#csv-templates) and [schemas/field definitions](../schemas/index.md#schemas) to aid you in completing the templates.

## Minimal annotation 

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

**When completing the Resource Tracker for your study**: 

* Minimal annotation implies that you will list and annotate relevant study resources in the resource tracker ONLY if you will share those files in a public data repository
* When completing the Resource Tracker you will NOT list and annotate relevant study files if they will not be shared in a public data repository
* See the alternative: [Wholistic Annotation](#wholistic-annotation)

<details>
<summary> Advantages</summary>
    <ul>
    <li> You only catalog the data and non-data supporting files that you will share/submit to a repository.</li>
    <li> Especially if you are late in your study, Minimal Annotation may be less time consuming than the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), because you are listing and annotating fewer files (i.e. only the files that will be shared , versus all files that will be shared AND all files that will NOT be shared) in the Resource Tracker for your study.</li>
    <li>This approach still provides a lot of value to researchers who may find your study - It will help them to parse what the study was trying to do, how the study was designed, what has been made available, whether or not the data that has been made available may be useful for their purposes (e.g. secondary data analysis, comparison to their own results, etc.), and even whether it may be useful to reach out to the study group of origin to request data that has not been provided or to set up a formal collaboration.</li>
    <li>This approach allows you to fulfill minimal data sharing requirements.</li>

</details>

<details >
<summary> Caveats</summary>
    <ul >
    <li> As compared to the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), you don’t get the full local annotation benefit that would come with fully cataloguing all data and non-data/supporting files relevant to a study (including files you will not share/submit to a repository), and how they relate to each other and to published results – these benefits include <i>facilitating continuity and passed-down knowledge within study groups</i>, and discovery, sharing, and re-use of the data and knowledge produced by the study outside of the original study group.</li>
    <li>As compared to the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), you may not get the full benefit of added study discoverability and transparencty for potential secondary data users and collaborators that the Resource Tracker can provide.</li>
  
</details>

</div>

## Wholistic annotation 

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

**When completing the Resource Tracker for your study**: 

* Wholistic annotation implies that you will list and annotate relevant study resources without regard for whether (or not) you will share those files in a public data repository
* When completing the Resource Tracker you will list and annotate relevant study files that will be shared AND those that will NOT be shared
* When listing/annotating a file that will NOT be shared, access level should be set to "permanent-private" to indicate that the file will not be shared 
* See the alternative: [Minimal Annotation](#minimal-annotation)


<details>
<summary> Advantages</summary>
    <ul>
    <li> Maximizes transparency and allows other researchers interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project and the data when accessing study documentation.</li>
    <li> allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by another researcher.</li>
    <li> You get the benefit of full local annotation, which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study.</li>
    <li> Documenting and sharing all metadata associated with your study can increase the discoverability of your study.</li>

</details>

<details >
<summary> Caveats</summary>
    <ul >
    <li> Especially if you are late in your study, Wholistic Annotation may be more time consuming than the alternative (Minimal Annotation), because you are listing and annotating more files (i.e. files that will be shared AND files that will NOT be shared, versus ONLY files that will be shared) in the Resource Tracker for your study.</li>

</div>

## As-you-go annotation 

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

As-you-go annotation implies that you will begin the [data packaging and annotation process](../overview/how.md) right away; you will audit and annotate all study resources already created, and keep up with annotation as you move through the remainder of your study timeline; you will generally audit and annotate all study resources regardless of whether these resources will ultimately be shared at a public data repository (["wholistic" annotation](#wholistic-annotation)) 

See the alternative: [Top-down Annotation](#top-down-annotation)

**As you move through the [data packaging process steps](../overview/how.md), "as-you-go" annotation implies that you will**: 

1. Audit relevant files

  * **Start this right away** 
    * Audit all files/resources already collected or produced by or for your study
    * Determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation)

2. Organize and consistently name your files and folders 

  * **Start this right away**
    * Consider using [HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources](name.md) to establish naming and organization conventions that should be followed for all study files, including for files that already exist and for new study files/resources as they are collected or produced
    * Align file name/organization of existing study files to the conventions you established in the step above - this may require you to change file names and locations for already-existing files (NOTE: do not duplicate files in order to align with name/org conventions as this may lead to confusion down the road as to which copy is the "source of truth") 

    
3. Add [Standard data package metadata - File-level](#standard-data-package-metadata-file-level)

  * [Data Dictionary](#data-dictionary)

    * **Start this right away**
      * Audit existing study files to identify any tabular data files that may have already been collected or produced by or for the study
      * Create a data dictionary for any existing tabular data files right away
      * If/when any new tabular data files are collected or produced by or for the study, create a data dictionary for the new tabular data file(s) right away and save them using file name and organization conventions you have established for your study (see step 2 above)

  * [Results Tracker](#results-tracker)

    * **Start this right away**: 
      * Determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation)

    * **Wait until your study is at the point of producing manuscript(s)** (e.g. figures, tables, text statements)
      * Once your study has reached this point, and <u>if your study has determined that a data sharing goal of the study is to provide results-support</u>, start annotating results right away, even if you have not formally begun to add them to a publication or report
      * As new results are produced by your study, annotate each result right away
      * Once your study has started to formally add final results to a publication, start adding result annotation files you've already produced (in the step just above) to a results tracker document for the publication - one results tracker per publication
      * As new publications or reports are produced by your study, use the result annotation files you create for each result included in the publication to create a results tracker document for the new publication


4. Add [Standard data package metadata - Study-level](#standard-data-package-metadata-study-level)

  * [Experiment Tracker](#experiment-tracker)

    * **Start this right away**
      * Audit all component experiments or other activities that will be part of your study
      * Start annotating study component experiments or activities that have already been designed
      * If/when any new study component experiments or activities are designed, annotate each new study component experiment or activity right away          

  * [Resource Tracker](#resource-tracker)

    * **Start this right away**
      * Audit all files/resources already collected or produced by or for your study (see step 1 above)
      * Establish file naming and organization conventions for your study files and make any necessary adjustments to current study file naming/organization to align with these conventions (see step 2 above)
      * Systematically annotate all files/resources already collected or produced by or for your study right away
      * Once you've annotated all files/resources already produced by or for your study, add these resource annotation files to your resource tracker
      * As new files/resources are collected or produced by or for your study, save them using the file naming and organization conventions you established previously, and annotate each new resource right away

         



<details>
<summary> Advantages</summary>
    <ul>
    <li> Spreads out annotation and data packaging work across the course of the study so that burden at the end of the stusy is minimal.</li>
    <li> You get the benefit of full local annotation, which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study.</li>
    <li> Maximizes transparency and allows other researchers interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project and the data when accessing study documentation.</li>

<details>
<summary> Caveats</summary>
    <ul>
    <li markdown="span"> The "as-you-go" annotation approach, **when applied broadly as outlined above** is strongly recommended for study groups that are early on in their study as the burden of starting up is relatively light when few study files/resources have so far been collected or produced by or for the study. However, the start up burden of this approach may be quite substantial for studies groups that are late or even well into their study and have already accumulated many study files/resources, and we generally recommend these groups consider the alternative, more goal-focused and narrow annotation approach: [Top-down annotation](#top-down-annotation).
    </li>
    <li markdown="span"> **The "as-you-go" annotation approach may also be applied in a narrower sense**, especially by study groups that are later in their study and who will not apply the "as-you-go" annotation approach in the broadest sense. This implies that studies will consider the whole packaging overview process and complete items as they can, as opposed to waiting until the very end (for example, when they are about to submit a study manuscript for peer review) to start the process. Some examples include, 1) auditing study files for tabular data files, creating data dictionaries for existing tabular data files right away, and creating data dictionaries right away for new tabular data files as the study collects or produces them, 2) annotating results the study group knows will or likely will be included in a final manuscript as they are produced, and creating a results tracker for final manuscript documents as drafts begin to be forumulated by the study group, 3) annotating component experiments and other activities that are part of the study right away if already designed, or as soon as they are designed (especially if it is clear that the experiment or activity will or likely will produce data that will be used to support/produce results that will be included in a final manuscript).
    </li>
    </ul>

</div>

## Top-down annotation 

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

Top-down annotation implies that you will generally implement the [data packaging and annotation process](../overview/how.md) in a somewhat narrower, more goal-oriented manner as compared to how you would implement if using the alternative [As-you-go annotation](#as-you-go-annotation) approach; You will generally determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation), then wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the publication containing a set of results for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating); you will then audit and annotate the subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the results or dataset already created, and annotate this subset of study resources right away; when you take the "top down" annotation approach, you will generally audit the full subset of study resources required to support your result(s) and/or dataset regardless of whether these resources will ultimately be shared at a public data repository, however you may choose to 1) annotate all resources in this subset regardless of whether they will be shared in a public repository (["wholistic" annotation](#wholistic-annotation)), or 2) annotate only the resources in this subset that will be shared in a public repository (["minimal" annotation](#minimal-annotation))

See the alternative: [As-you-go Annotation](#as-you-go-annotation)

**As you move through the [data packaging process steps](../overview/how.md), "top-down" annotation implies that you will**: 

1. Audit relevant files

  * **Start this right away**: 
    * Determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation)

  * **Wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product** (i.e. respectively, the manuscript or publication containing a set of results for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating)
    * Audit the full subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the goal sharing product(s) (i.e. publication or dataset)

2. Organize and consistently name your files and folders 

  * **Start this right away**:
    * Determine if you are early in your study
    * If you are early in your study: 

      * Consider using [HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources](name.md) to establish naming and organization conventions that should be followed for all study files, including for files that already exist and for new study files/resources as they are collected or produced
      * Align file name/organization of existing study files to the conventions you established in the step above - this may require you to change file names and locations for already-existing files (NOTE: do not duplicate files in order to align with name/org conventions as this may lead to confusion down the road as to which copy is the "source of truth") 

    * If you are late in your study:

      * We generally recommend that you leave file names and organization as is 
      * You may use the approach laid out above for those early in their study, however if you are late in your study and have accumulated many study files already, establishing file naming and organization conventions now and back-applying them may be quite burdensome and potentially prone to error
      * If you have sets of "like" files (e.g. a similarly formatted tabular data file or brain imaging file per study subject per study timepoint), it may be well worth establishing file naming and organization conventions based on [HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources](name.md) now and back-applying them just for these file sets - doing so will make it possible/easier to annotate these file sets in one go instead of annotating them singly one at a time, and so may substantially reduce annotation/data-sharing burden for the study group   


    
3. Add [Standard data package metadata - File-level](#standard-data-package-metadata-file-level)

  * [Data Dictionary](#data-dictionary)

    * **Start this right away**: 
      * Determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation)

    * **Wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product** (i.e. respectively, the manuscript or publication containing a set of results for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating)
      * Audit the full subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the goal sharing product(s) (i.e. manuscript or dataset)
      * Among this subset of files, identify any tabular data files 
      * Create a data dictionary for these tabular data files right away

        

  * [Results Tracker](#results-tracker)

    * **Start this right away**: 
      * Determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation)

    * **Wait until your study is at the point of producing manuscript(s)** (e.g. figures, tables, text statements)
      * Once your study has reached this point, and <u>if your study has determined that a data sharing goal of the study is to provide results-support</u>, start annotating results right away that are likely to be included in a final manuscript or report you will share and for which you would like to provide results-support, even if you have not formally begun to add them to a publication or report
      * As new results are produced by your study, annotate each result right away
      * Once your study has started to formally add final results to a publication, start adding result annotation files you've already produced (in the step just above) to a results tracker document for the publication - one results tracker per publication
      * As new publications are produced by your study, use the result annotation files you create for each result in the publication or report to create a results tracker document for the new publication or report
      * Alternatively, you may wait until your study is at the point of a final manuscript or report for which you would like to provide results-support; then start annotating only the results that are positively contained in this publication 


4. Add [Standard data package metadata - Study-level](#standard-data-package-metadata-study-level)

  * [Experiment Tracker](#experiment-tracker)

    * **Start this right away** OR **Wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product**
      * Audit all component experiments or other activities that are or will be part of your study
      * Identify the subset of component experiments or other activities that positively produced or are likely to produce data or other products that are required to interpret, use, or reproduce your goal data sharing product (i.e. manuscript(s) or dataset(s) you want to share/disseminate)
      * Start annotating this subset of study component experiments or activities if they have already been designed
      * If/when any new study component experiments or activities are designed and it is determined that the new experiment/activity produced or is likely to produce data or other products that are required to interpret, use, or reproduce your goal data sharing product, annotate this new study component experiment(s) or activity(s) right away          

  * [Resource Tracker](#resource-tracker)

    * **Wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product** (i.e. manuscript or publication, or a dataset you want to share/disseminate)
      * audit the full subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the goal sharing product(s) (i.e. manuscript or dataset) (see step 1 above)
      * starting with your goal data sharing product (i.e. manuscript, or a dataset you want to share/disseminate), systematically annotate **either**:
        
        * all files/resources in this subset of study resources regardless of whether they will be shared in a public data repository (["wholistic" annotation](#wholistic-annotation))
        * only the files/resources in this subset of study resources that will be shared in a public data repository (["minimal" annotation](#minimal-annotation))

      * once you've annotated all files/resources, add these resource annotation files to your resource tracker

<summary> Advantages</summary>
    <ul>
    <li> "Top-down" annotation allows for a narrower and more goal-focused approach to annotation and data-sharing as compared to the alternative "As-you-go" annotation; This approach may be very appealing to study groups that are well into their study as it reduces annotation and data sharing burden by focusing on producing the essential annotation needed to ensure that the results or datasets they share are discoverable, interpretable, reusable, and replicable by researchers and other potential collaborators.</li>
    <li> Concentrates annotation and data packaging work at the end of the study which allows singular focus on the task and may speed the process.</li>
    <li> If you choose to use "wholistic" annotation with the "top-down" annotation approach, you get the benefit of full local annotation of the files underlying your study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset), which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study. Even if you choose to use "minimal" annotation with the "top down" approach you still get the benefit of some local annotation to support preserving institutional knowledge within your study group.</li>
    <li> If you choose to use "wholistic" annotation with the "top-down" annotation approach, you maximize transparency and allow other researchers interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project and the data that explicitly underlies your study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) when accessing study documentation. Even if you choose to use "minimal" annotation with the "top down" approach you still provide a lot of transparency about what data and non-data supporting files you are sharing to support your study's goal data sharing product, how these files relate to each other and how to use and interpret these files; this presents a huge value to potential secondary data users or collaborators.</li>
    <li> If you choose to use "wholistic" annotation with the "top-down" annotation approach, this still allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility, interpretability and use of the study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by another researcher.</li>
    <li> If you choose to use "wholistic" annotation with the "top-down" annotation approach, this allows for documenting and sharing all metadata associated with the study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) and this can increase the discoverability of your study.</li>

## Data Package

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

A data package is made up of your study files and the Standard Data Package Metadata, a set of metadata files that describe your study, study files and results, and study file and results relationships.

</div>

## Shareable Data Package

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

A shareable data package is a zip archive produced locally that is ready to be submitted to a repository. A shareable data package includes only files to be shared to a repository. There are multiple "flavors" of shareable data package depending on how and when files are designated to be shared:

* open-access now
* open-access-by-date (i.e., embargoed through a specific date)
* managed-access now
* managed-access-by-date (i.e.,embargoed through a specific date)

## Data-sharing Orientation

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px;">

A study group's goal(s) for data-sharing. 

People will have different goals in sharing data and non-data supporting files/resources from their study. These goals, or 'orientations' may be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, study staff resources and time constraints, investigator preference, and requirements imposed by a funder, journal, or other entity somehow governing the study.  

Determining what your goals are for data sharing will help [guide you](../fit/index.md) in determining what you will include in your [data package](#data-package) and how and when you will annotate the data and non-data supporting files/resources in your data package.

There are two main data-sharing "orientations." These data sharing goals or "orientations" are not mutually exclusive. You may choose both **Results-support** and **Dataset-sharing** as goals for your study's data sharing goal.

### Results-support 

* The study group wants to share data and non-data supporting files specifically to support results shared in a published manuscript or other venue (e.g. presentation, poster, report, etc.)
* They will share items required to interpret, replicate, or use these results

### Dataset-sharing

* The study group wants to share a specific dataset(s); 
  * perhaps the group has collected/created a very rich dataset and used this dataset to ask and publish results related to specific scientific questions; 
  * they believe other study groups may be able to leverage this dataset to ask and publish results related to other scientific questions that may be related or unrelated to the questions the dataset was originally collected to help investigate 
* The study group wants to share this specific dataset(s), as well as the data and non-data supporting files specifically to support use of this dataset(s)
* They will share items required to interpret, replicate, or use this dataset(s)
