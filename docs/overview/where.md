# Where should you create a data package?


### Data Package

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

Create your data package locally, wherever you store the data and non-data supporting files collected or produced by or for your study 

* Do not move or replicate any files to accommodate the data packaging process
* Creating your "data package" amounts to creating and completing [**Standard data package metadata files**](../terms/index.md#standard-data-package-metadata-files) for your study to add context and usability info about your existing data and non-data supporting files
* You will save these Standard data package metadata files in a single file folder/directory, and save this single file folder/directory as a sub-directory within your study file/folder directory

### Shareable Data Package

<div markdown="1" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: top; padding:10px 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

* Creating your data package by creating and completing **Standard data package metadata files** for your study will allow creation of a "shareable" version of your data package that: 
  * Includes only files that have been specified as shareable to a public repository, and
  * Is organized in a manner that facilitates submission to a public repository and human interpretability of the submitted file structure 
     
This "shareable" version of your data package will also be created locally, and may subsequently be submitted to a public data repository by study staff.
