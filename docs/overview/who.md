# Who should create a data package?

1. **Sharing data**: Any investigator who will collect or produce data as part of their study, and who will share at least some of that data in a public data repository
2. **Not sharing data, but open to data requests and collaborators**: Any investigator who will collect or produce data as part of their study, and who, though not sharing data in a public data repository, is open to data requests and collaborators
  * Creating a data package will facilitate creation of a "shareable" data package that contains only data or non-data supporting files the study group has indicated are to be shared in a public data repository
  * This allows, for example, public sharing of non-data supporting files that enable potential secondary data users or collaborators to determine that they are interested in the data and to contact the originating study group for access or collaboration requests, without sharing any data publicly
3. **Sharing methods and other non-data study products**: Any investigator who will collect or produce methods or other non-data study products as part of their study, and who will share at least some of those non-data study products in a public data repository
