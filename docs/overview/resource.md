## About the Resource Tracker
The resource tracker is an inventory and annotated list of all data and supporting/non-date files for the study.

## Purpose
1. **Guides interpretation, use, and replication**
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
        <li> Gives information on all/shared study artefacts, what items are shared, where/how to find them, how to understand/interpret those items</li
        <li>Documents who different items relate to each other and how they relate to the dataset and/or result the study group will share. This is useful for potential secondary data users as well as the original study group, which may need to reference/replicate past experiments/results across people and time.</li>
    </ol>
2. **Preparation for submission to a repository**
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
        <li>Can allow reconfiguration of file organization for sharing both in location and tiem based on the type of itme (e.g., data, metadata, code), access level (permanent private, temporary private, restricted access, public), date of access level change (e.g., shared access date)</li>
        <li>When submitting to a reposiotry with robust API infrastructure, can allow for automated submission with interpretable organization, respecting all access settings</li>
    </ol>

## How your study should implement the resource tracker will depend on three dimensions:
1. **Stage of accumulation of study artefacts (study stage)**
    * Have already accumulated many study artefacts, **OR**
    * Have accumulated relatively few or no study artefacts
2. **Data sharing 'orientation' (goal)**
    * Focused on sharing items that support your published results, **AND/OR**
    * Focused on sharing a useful dataset
3. **Annotation plan**
    * Documenting all study artefacts related to your data sharing goal(s), **OR**
    * Documenting only study artefacts related to your data sharing goal that will be shared in a public repository
