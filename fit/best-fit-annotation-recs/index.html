<p>Use an <a href="../../terms/#as-you-go-annotation">"As-you-go"</a> annotation approach; a <strong>detailed overview</strong> of what this involves can be found <a href="../../terms/#as-you-go-annotation">here</a>; a <strong>brief overview</strong> of what this involves follows below:</p>
<p><font size="3"> What to do <strong>right away</strong></font></p>
<ul>
<li>Start annotating "As-you-go" as soon as possible</li>
<li>Audit all <a href="../../terms/#study-filesresources">study files/resources</a> already produced by or for your study<ul>
<li>Consider applying <a href="../../file-o-and-n/">HEAL recommendations for file organization and naming</a> to these files now, and to future files as they are created</li>
<li>Where practicable to implement (without duplicating original files), organize all study files/resources into a single study folder/directory (study folder/directory may of course have sub-directories; see <a href="../../guidance/file-org/">here</a> for guidance on and examples of recommended study folder/directory structure)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Initialize your <a href="../../terms/#data-package">Data Package</a>  <ul>
<li>Create a <a href="../../terms/#dsc-pkg-folder">"dsc-pkg" folder/directory</a> that will hold all <a href="../../terms/#standard-data-package-metadata-files">Standard Data Package Metadata Files</a> for your data package<ul>
<li>If all study files/resources are organized into a single study folder/directory, create this folder/directory as a direct sub-directory of your study folder/directory, and name it "dsc-pkg"; consistency in naming and location of this folder/directory relative to your overall study folder/directory will make it easy to recognize as the folder that contains the Standard Data Package Metadata files for your study's data package</li>
<li>If not, create this folder/directory in a disc location that makes sense for you; name it "dsc-pkg", optionally appending a suffix to the name that will make it easy to recognize as "belonging" to a specific study (e.g. "dsc-pkg-study-1" or "dsc-pkg-mindfulness-for-oud"); consistency in naming (i.e. including the "dsc-pkg" prefix) and appending a suffix to the name that is a human-recongnizable identifier for the relevant study will make it easy to recognize as the folder that contains the Standard Data Package Metadata files for your study's data package  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a <a href="../../terms/#data-dictionary">Data Dictionary</a> for each existing <a href="../../terms/#tabular-data-file">tabular data file</a><ul>
