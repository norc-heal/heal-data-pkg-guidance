What is your data-sharing goal? Do you have low or no resources to devote to data-sharing efforts? Next steps \u00b6 Move through the \"best fit\" questions below . Select and record the answer option to each question that best fits you and your study. Based upon your study's answer selections, detailed guidance on how and when to create and complete your data package will be provided. The questions \u00b6 Study Stage \u00b6 How far along are you in your study? How far along you are in your study when you start to think about data sharing will affect how you document your data. For example, if you are near the beginning of your study, you may be able to create your data package and set up documentation processes such that you document as you move through your study. This will lead to more complete documentation and ease the process of data sharing in the future, as opposed to completing all documentation at the end of your study. If you are nearer the end of your study, we recommend you take a narrower, more goal-oriented approach to documentation to minimize data sharing burden on your study group, while maximizing value to potential secondary data users and collaborators. There are two options available for study stage. These study stage options are greatly simplified. For now, select the study stage that most closely fits with the stage you are at in your study . Value options Early Late Data-sharing Orientation \u00b6 What is your data-sharing goal? Determining what your goals are for data sharing will help guide you in determining what you will include in your future data package and how you will annotate the data and non-data supporting files/resources in your data package. People will have different goals in sharing data and non-data supporting files/resources from their study. These goals, or 'orientations' may be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, study staff resources and time constraints, and investigator preference. There are two main data sharing \"orientations.\" These data sharing goals or \"orientations\" are not mutually exclusive. You may choose both Results-support and Dataset-sharing as goals for your study's data sharing goal. See more about each data sharing orientation below, and select the data-sharing orientation(s) that most closely fit(s) with your study group's data sharing goals. Value options Results-support Dataset-sharing Data-sharing Resources \u00b6 Do you have low or no resources to devote to data sharing efforts? While it is sometimes the case that study groups don't explicitly budget and plan resources for data sharing efforts, many study groups have enough resources overall that they find they can still set some staff time and effort aside for data sharing efforts that will benefit potential secondary data users, the entire research community, and the originating study group. However in some cases, a study group may find themselves with a particularly low level of resources available to devote to data sharing efforts at the time they begin to consider fulfilling data sharing requirements attached to their study. They may for example have started out with a pretty tight study budget, or have already spent down most or all of the study budget, or have staff turnover that makes it difficult to spare person-time to the effort. Determining whether your study group may be in a more common position of having a standard level of resources available for data-sharing efforts, or whether your study group may be in the less common position of having a very low level of resources available will help guide you in determining how you will annotate the data and non-data supporting files/resources in your data package.

List any other dependencies of the dataset-of-interest in its Resource Tracker entry (e.g. raw data pieces, code, analysis plan) Next, add any items you have listed as associated files/dependencies of the finalized dataset-of-interest as resources to your Resource Tracker ONLY if the file will be shared in a public repository . Remember that whenever you add a tabular data file to your Resource Tracker, you should first create a Data Dictionary. Then, add the tabular file to the Resource Tracker and list the Data Dictionary you have created as a dependency. Finally, any file that has been added as an associated files/dependency of a resource in the Resource Tracker should also be added as a resource ONLY if it will be shared in a public repository . Repeat this process with the dependencies of these files until you're listing files without any dependencies. If there are any other study files that you will share in a public repository that have not already been added to the Resource Tracker, add them to the Resource Tracker now Congratulations! You have finished preparing your data package locally. You can now prepare your data package for submission to a public repository. Tip to confirm your local data package is ready for submission Before you share your data package, it may be useful to ask someone else in your study group to review your data package and annotations thinking about whether it would be accessible and understandable to a researcher looking at the data package for the first time. If they are able to easily understand the study structure and how they might go about replicating your dataset/results, that is a good sign that your data package has the necessary resources and adequate detail to be shared.","title":"Early, dataset-sharing, low resources"},{"location":"fit/best-fit-recs/early-data-low/#early-in-study-data-sharing-orientation-low-level-of-data-sharing-resources","text":"","title":"Early in Study, Data-Sharing Orientation, Low Level of Data Sharing Resources"},{"location":"fit/best-fit-recs/early-data-low/#data-packaging-timeline","text":"","title":"Data Packaging Timeline"},{"location":"fit/best-fit-recs/early-data-low/#what-to-do-right-away","text":"","title":"What to do right away"},{"location":"fit/best-fit-recs/early-data-low/#set-yourself-up-for-success","text":"Review all study files/resources already produced by or for your study Come up with file organization and naming conventions for your study folders and files now - Consider applying HEAL recommendations for file organization and naming .

Genomic data is complex and highly identifying, especially in combination with other information (e.g., other genomic data types, phenotypic information, etc.), which makes it very difficult to adequately anonymize. There is not currently consensus on best practice for deidentification of genomic data, although some methods have shown promise. Deidentification methods for this type of data will also likely continue to rapidly advance and shift over time as the field of genomic research expands and the number of researchers interested in sharing this type of data increases. There are a number of different strategies that researchers have utilized to attempt to adequately anonymize this type of data, with varying success. Strategies and recommendations range from only sharing summary data to sharing individual level data with phenotype-only de-identification with strong access controls, to using complex statistical methods, such as differential privacy to additionally de-identify the genotype data directly (still with strong access controls). Given the difficulty of anonymizing this data adequately, the best practice at this time is to apply current best practices in deidentification of this type of data, in consultation with a statistician or other individual familiar with genomic privacy considerations, supplemented by privacy and governance protections . Privacy and governance protections can include applying access controls, data use agreements, and physical and electronic security protocols. Note about NIH-funded Genomic Research If your study is funded by NIH and will generate genomic or sequencing data, you must adhere to the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy . The genomic data sharing policy provides a framework for genomic data sharing, but some individual NIH Institutes and Centers (IC) may have additional requirements for genomic data sharing. You should review your specific funding IC requirements to help determine what you are required to submit, requirements for submission timing in relation to data collection, and which of the below deidentification methods you should pursue. Although there is not consensus on best practices for deidentifying this type of data, investigators can generally choose from a few different options when considering how to share their genomic data: Option 1 : Share summary data only If you would like to use this approach and your study is funded by NIH, review the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy guidelines and those of your specific funding IC to ensure that sharing summary data only is sufficient to fulfill data sharing requirements for your grant. Option 2 : Share individual-level data When using this approach, you should share your data in a repository that allows for sharing with strict access controls . Generally, a repository with strict access controls in place will require that anyone who wants to access managed access data to put in a formal request for access and may require they provide an IRB-approved research proposal for how they will use the data. Depending on the level of access controls applied, a repository may also require researchers requesting to access the data to sign a data use agreement (DUA) and may only permit users to work with the data in a secure environment. Additionally, if you pursue this option, some amount of deidentification will be required Generally, deidentification is the responsibility of the investigator or study group . However, some repositories may provide some support or resources for deidentification. See the HEAL Data Stewards guidance on repositories and repository selection for more information on repository selection and support. Best practice : Work with an expert of deidentification There are two options for deidentifying when sharing individual-level data with strict access controls: Option A : Phenotype-only deidentification This involves deidentifying only the clinical/phenotype data that accompanies genotype data but not deidentifying the genotype data Note : This is the approach dbGaP suggests for data submitted to their repository; dbGaP additionally implements very strong access controls to protect the data Option B : Phenotype and genotype deidentification This approach involves the use of complex statistical methods that have been used with some success in deidentification of genomic data such as differential privacy tools/algorithms Although with this approach, the resulting dataset with have deidentified phenotypic and genotypic data, this data will likely still require strict access controls due to its sensitivity.

There are a few reasons why it may be useful to submit your RNA-seq or other sequencing data to SRA. Submitting this type of data to SRA, a repository explicitly reserved for sequencing data, will greatly increase your data\u2019s discoverability and accessibility over a generalist repository. SRA will also prompt you to provide standardized metadata that is appropriate and tailored to your data type and population of study, which generalist repositories may not. You may run into issues submitting RNA-seq and other sequencing data to repositories not specifically geared towards this type of data. Sequencing files are often very large, and you may run into size restrictions and/or fees in trying to upload files. SRA submission does have some limitations. SRA does not have the capacity to store other data types/documents beyond sequencing files. Therefore, we recommend you package and submit other data types/documents related to your study to a different repository, making sure to link your studies between the two repositories (to the extent possible). Throughout this step-by-step guidance, we will refer you to find more information/detail from an existing step-by-step guide on submission to SRA (referred to as \"step-by-step guide\" in the instructions below). This is a very good resource with detailed information and definitions, including screenshots. We recommend you have it open as you work through the steps below. There are also additional resources listed at the bottom of this document that may be useful to review ahead of working through these steps. Create an NCBI Account \u00b6 Navigate to the SRA website . Create an NCBI Account. You can use a single account for all submissions you make to SRA. NOTE: You may already have an account with an affiliate (e.g., ORCID, NIH, Gmail) that would enable you to sign in to NCBI without explicitly creating an NCBI account. Register Your BioProject \u00b6 First, you will need to create a BioProject . This BioProject will contain all of the BioSamples that you will create in the next step and all the corresponding RNA-seq data. To create your BioProject, you will need to fill out information in each of 7 tabs. For detailed information on how to complete the fields, please see the \"step-by-step guide\" . Submitter Project Type Target General Info Note : This step provides an opportunity to link your SRA data to a submission at another repository in the External Links field. For example, if you have a data package shared (or in progress) at Harvard Dataverse, you would enter the link to your Harvard Dataverse dataset in the External links field, including a brief explanation of the fact that other data for the project is contained in the linked project at the Harvard Dataverse repository. This will mean that whenever someone accesses your BioProject page, they will be able to quickly find the rest of your data at Harvard Dataverse. BioSample Note : Although there is a BioSample tab in this step, you will not include BioSample information here, as you have not yet registered the BioSample(s) (that will happen in the next step). You will be able to link your BioSample(s) and BioProject later, in the \"Submit your Data\" section (i.e., when submitting raw reads). Publications Overview After you create a BioProject, you will be provided with a BioProject ID . This will be in the format of PRJNAXXXXXX. Note It is difficult to edit the information entered in this step after submission; any changes require you to get in touch with SRA via email. Therefore, it is advised to ensure that details provided are accurate prior to submission. Register Your BioSample(s) \u00b6 Go to the BioSample submission page . Click on the BioSample link and choose New Submission. You can submit information on multiple BioSamples at once. If you have multiple BioSamples, you will likely want to batch add all BioSamples for the same BioProject at once. You will be asked to provide metadata about the BioSamples you want to batch add. You will need to complete seven tabs of information: Submitter General info Sample type Attributes Note : This is where you will be prompted to download and fill out a metadata template to batch add the BioSamples. Make sure you download the correct Excel template for your BioSample Type. This Excel contains tooltips for each column to explain what should go in each cell for the BioSample metadata. For additional detailed information on how to fill out this template, refer to the step-by-step guide . Each of the BioSample rows must be unique, so although many of the characteristics of your BioSamples may be similar, it is important to ensure that they are distinguishable on some of the data entered into the metadata template. BioProject Note : This is where you can enter your registered BioProject number created in the previous step; you can also wait until the next step (\"Submit your Data\") to associate your BioSamples and BioProject. Description Overview Once you submit your BioSample(s), you will be provided with BioSample ID(s) . These will be in the format of SAMNXXXX. Note It is difficult to edit the information entered in this step after submission; any changes require you to get in touch with SRA via email. Therefore, it is advised to ensure that details provided are accurate prior to submission. Submit Your Data \u00b6 The next step is submission. Navigate to the SRA submission portal and select new submission. As part of submission, you will need to do an additional round of metadata creation, where you will provide information about the sequencing. You will need to fill out information in five tabs: Submitter General info Note : This is where you would add your BioProject ID if you did not do so in the previous step. SRA metadata Note : This involves preparation of an external file, which you will be prompted to download, fill out, and upload. This template is set up as one row per raw read/sequencing experiment (e.g., there could be more than one row/sequencing experiment per BioSample if you split a BioSample into multiple aliquots and performed different sequencing on each aliquot). Detailed information on how to fill out the Excel metadata template is included in the linked \"step-by-step guide.\" Once you complete the template, you must save it as a tab-delimited txt file to upload. Files Note : This is the step where you will upload the raw reads. You can upload the raw reads in a number of ways, depending on the number and size of files you are submitting as well as your personal comfort with using command line tools. Please refer to the \"step-by-step guide\" and the SRA File Upload page in the SRA submission quick start guide for information on the options and how to select the one that fits best with your data. When selecting files to upload (regardless of upload method), ensure that the files you select to upload completely align with the files inventoried in the SRA metadata spreadsheet in the previous step. If the SRA metadata spreadsheet does not match the files uploaded in this step, you will receive an error that you uploaded one or more files that are not in your metadata table. Overview Upon submission, you will receive email confirmation regarding your submission title, submission ID, and BioProject ID. Linking Repository Submissions \u00b6 As mentioned previously, if you submit the rest of your study files/documentation at another repository, we recommend creating a linkage between your SRA submission and your other repository using the External links field in the SRA submission process. We also recommend, where possible, creating a similar linkage to your SRA submission from your other repository. This might mean linking to your SRA study from your other repository, including the BioProject ID within the study description at your other repository, or something else. The way to operationalize this will depend on the repository, so we recommend you review your repository's documentation for guidance. Resources \u00b6 Here are some additional resources that may be helpful as you work through the steps above: Good Citizenship Made Easy: A Step-by-Step Guide to Submitting RNA-Seq Data to NCBI : This article contains step-by-step guidance including screenshots of how to submit RNA-seq data to SRA. This is the \"step-by-step guide\" document referenced throughout the above instructions.

There are a few reasons why it may be useful to submit your RNA-seq or other sequencing data to SRA. Submitting this type of data to SRA, a repository explicitly reserved for sequencing data, will greatly increase your data\u2019s discoverability and accessibility over a generalist repository. SRA will also prompt you to provide standardized metadata that is appropriate and tailored to your data type and population of study, which generalist repositories may not. You may run into issues submitting RNA-seq and other sequencing data to repositories not specifically geared towards this type of data. Sequencing files are often very large, and you may run into size restrictions and/or fees in trying to upload files. SRA submission does have some limitations. SRA does not have the capacity to store other data types/documents beyond sequencing files. Therefore, we recommend you package and submit other data types/documents related to your study to a different repository, making sure to link your studies between the two repositories (to the extent possible). Throughout this step-by-step guidance, we will refer you to find more information/detail from an existing step-by-step guide on submission to SRA (referred to as \"step-by-step guide\" in the instructions below). This is a very good resource with detailed information and definitions, including screenshots. We recommend you have it open as you work through the steps below. There are also additional resources listed at the bottom of this document that may be useful to review ahead of working through these steps.","title":"Submitting RNA-seq data to Sequence Read Archive (SRA)"},{"location":"g-and-r/repo/submit/srasubmit/#create-an-ncbi-account","text":"Navigate to the SRA website . Create an NCBI Account. You can use a single account for all submissions you make to SRA. NOTE: You may already have an account with an affiliate (e.g., ORCID, NIH, Gmail) that would enable you to sign in to NCBI without explicitly creating an NCBI account.","title":"Create an NCBI Account"},{"location":"g-and-r/repo/submit/srasubmit/#register-your-bioproject","text":"First, you will need to create a BioProject . This BioProject will contain all of the BioSamples that you will create in the next step and all the corresponding RNA-seq data. To create your BioProject, you will need to fill out information in each of 7 tabs. For detailed information on how to complete the fields, please see the \"step-by-step guide\" . Submitter Project Type Target General Info Note : This step provides an opportunity to link your SRA data to a submission at another repository in the External Links field. For example, if you have a data package shared (or in progress) at Harvard Dataverse, you would enter the link to your Harvard Dataverse dataset in the External links field, including a brief explanation of the fact that other data for the project is contained in the linked project at the Harvard Dataverse repository. This will mean that whenever someone accesses your BioProject page, they will be able to quickly find the rest of your data at Harvard Dataverse. BioSample Note : Although there is a BioSample tab in this step, you will not include BioSample information here, as you have not yet registered the BioSample(s) (that will happen in the next step). You will be able to link your BioSample(s) and BioProject later, in the \"Submit your Data\" section (i.e., when submitting raw reads). Publications Overview After you create a BioProject, you will be provided with a BioProject ID . This will be in the format of PRJNAXXXXXX. Note It is difficult to edit the information entered in this step after submission; any changes require you to get in touch with SRA via email. Therefore, it is advised to ensure that details provided are accurate prior to submission.","title":"Register Your BioProject"},{"location":"g-and-r/repo/submit/srasubmit/#register-your-biosamples","text":"Go to the BioSample submission page . Click on the BioSample link and choose New Submission. You can submit information on multiple BioSamples at once. If you have multiple BioSamples, you will likely want to batch add all BioSamples for the same BioProject at once. You will be asked to provide metadata about the BioSamples you want to batch add. You will need to complete seven tabs of information: Submitter General info Sample type Attributes Note : This is where you will be prompted to download and fill out a metadata template to batch add the BioSamples. Make sure you download the correct Excel template for your BioSample Type. This Excel contains tooltips for each column to explain what should go in each cell for the BioSample metadata. For additional detailed information on how to fill out this template, refer to the step-by-step guide . Each of the BioSample rows must be unique, so although many of the characteristics of your BioSamples may be similar, it is important to ensure that they are distinguishable on some of the data entered into the metadata template. BioProject Note : This is where you can enter your registered BioProject number created in the previous step; you can also wait until the next step (\"Submit your Data\") to associate your BioSamples and BioProject. Description Overview Once you submit your BioSample(s), you will be provided with BioSample ID(s) . These will be in the format of SAMNXXXX.

Navigate to the SRA submission portal and select new submission. As part of submission, you will need to do an additional round of metadata creation, where you will provide information about the sequencing. You will need to fill out information in five tabs: Submitter General info Note : This is where you would add your BioProject ID if you did not do so in the previous step. SRA metadata Note : This involves preparation of an external file, which you will be prompted to download, fill out, and upload. This template is set up as one row per raw read/sequencing experiment (e.g., there could be more than one row/sequencing experiment per BioSample if you split a BioSample into multiple aliquots and performed different sequencing on each aliquot). Detailed information on how to fill out the Excel metadata template is included in the linked \"step-by-step guide.\" Once you complete the template, you must save it as a tab-delimited txt file to upload.

A data package contains the following: Research data files or links to data files accessible or stored elsewhere Non-data, supporting files such as protocols, data collection instruments, code for manipulating or analyzing the data, discipline-specific metadata files describing the data, and additional documentation Standard data package metadata files that are both human- and machine-readable Shareable data package \u00b6 A shareable data package is a version of the data package that has been prepared for submission to a public data repository, and meets the following three requirements: All of the files are intended for sharing, either publicly or under a data use agreement (DUA) or specific set of restrictions. Sufficient information on the provenance and terms of use are included to make the data reusable. Sufficient metadata and documentation are included so that the package may be used by a researcher unconnected to and without special knowledge of the original study. Producing a shareable data package & Other important points \u00b6 Typically, a data package can be converted to a shareable data package simply by redacting any items that cannot be shared, replacing them with an appropriate substitute or placeholder whenever possible. For example, a researcher may replace dates within a sensitive dataset with shifted dates or topcode certain variables to help maintain participant confidentiality. Such changes are ideally made prior to analysis so that the original investigator is analyzing the exact same data file(s) that will be shared to facilitate reproduciblity. A common and important case is when none of the data can be shared, and thus all of the data file(s) must be excluded from the shareable data package. For example, a research project may exclusively be analyzing secondary data that, while broadly accessible, may not be redistributed (research data available from public repositories often falls into this category). In such cases, the data may be physically stored outside the shareable data package and replaced with a link to the data; the resulting shareable data package may then be shared with and used by researchers who independently obtain access to the data. In this way, one may think of a shareable data package as supporting the use a particular dataset for a specific purpose (e.g. replicating an analysis performed by the authors of the data package), whether are not the data themselves are contained in the package . Metadata files provide context and usability \u00b6 Data sharing requirements by funders or journals are often stated in general terms only (e.g., \"You must share all data underlying published results\"). This creates two problems: (1) a researcher may nominally comply by simply sharing his or her existing files, which may or may not be usable by others; and (2) it leads researchers to focus on the data only, to the exclusion of metadata and other resources (e.g. codebooks, code) that are needed to use the data effectively and/or increase their scientific value. Aside from the data themselves, it is important for investigators to provide context and usability information, including: what questions was the study group trying to answer in collecting the data, how did they design study experiment(s)/activity(s) to answer those questions, how was data collected, what data was collected, what is in each data file, how to use it, how it relates to other data files, how it relates to published results, etc. In fact, supporting or metadata files that include this context and usability information are arguably as or more important than the data itself . Without the context information, it is difficult for potential secondary data users or collaborators to get even a high-level sense of whether it may be productive to request access to study data or to reach out regarding a collaboration with the originating study group. Without the usability information, it is difficult for potential secondary data users or collaborators to get a more granular view of whether the collected data may be usable for their secondary data use purposes, and it may be difficult or impossible to understand and actually use the data for their secondary data use purpose. Some research communities have clear standards for how to create and provide at least some of the critical metadata required to ensure discoverability, understanding, and usability of commonly collected data types (e.g. neuroimaging, genomice, GIS) or datasets collected in the course of a commonly conducted study type (e.g. clinical trial). These standards are incredibly valuable and essential for detailed discovery and reuse of especially very complex data and study types. Research communities should always be in charge of forging the standards very specific to their own community as they are, indeed, the only ones with the deep knowledge and experience to do so. Standard Data Package Metadata as a bridge across communities \u00b6 However, especially in the context of an effort like the NIH HEAL Initiative, which spans many research communities (e.g. pain, opioids, basic science, pre-clinical, clinical, wet-lab, computational, materials and methods development, community-based, surveys, observational, qualitative, pharma, business development), and seeks to promote discoverability, interpretability, and usability of all funded research across these communities, and by both researchers and a broader audience (e.g. community-members, community-based organizations, journalists), research community specific standards alone may fall short of enabling full discoverability, interpretability, and usability across this wide spectrum of data and knowledge producers and consumers, due to: Within specific research community standards Inconsistent or missing content or format recommendations impacting data types, datasets, and data collections collected within the context of the specific research community E.g. A standard specifies the need for a data dictionary, but does not provide further specification, so that some people provide it as a PDF, others as a Word document, and still others as an Excel document with a header row containing explanatory notes Across specific research community standards No one specific research community standard can be adopted by all communities It would miss standards needed by other communities It would require or recommend standards not needed or even nonsensical for other communities If each community adopted their own community specific standard and did nothing else , there would be a lack of discoverability and usability across communities Some communities lack clear standards, and so would implement no or inconsistent/ad hoc standards Inward-facing research community specific standards may assume knowledge and understanding that cannot be taken for granted outside of that community both with respect to organization of data and metadata, and with respect to terminology used to describe it Inconsistent content or format recommendations across research communities - E.g. Many community standards require a description of the overall study in some format, however the content and format varies - some specify to provide this is a readme.txt document, others as entered into structured forms such as when registering a clinical trial on clinicaltrials.gov or a genomic study on dbGaP , and still others do not specify a format; content varies across all of these examples The HEAL Initiative has developed Standard Data Package Metadata and best practices as to when and how to implement these metadata, to be leveraged by all studies across all research communities, as a way to bridge across research communities and other data and knowledge producer and consumer communities. Standard Data Package Metadata are a small set of standard metadata file types that, altogether, provide essential usability and context information about the study as a whole and about the data files your study has produced/collected. These metadata files should be included in all HEAL Initiative data packages. They produce a common language and universally understandable structure for all studies across the spectrum of research communities that are a part of the HEAL Initiative.

A shareable data package includes the subset of study files that you intend to share, while excluding study files that you do NOT intend to share. There are several different \"flavors\" or types of shareable data package that allow you to share study files in different ways (e.g. open access, managed access, right away, under embargo until a specific date, etc.), and if you want to share different sets of study files in different ways, you may want to create more than one shareable data package of different flavors to accomplish this easily. This section will walk through the different ways you may want to share your data, why you might want to share your data in different ways, the flavors or types of shareable data packages that allow you to share in different ways, how to determine which study files should go into your shareable data package depending upon the flavor or type of your shareable data package you're creating, and how to finalize your shareable data package or packages for submission to a data repository.

Why you might want to share your data in different ways \u00b6 Depending on your specific study situation, you may not want to share all your files in a public data repository regardless of how protected they may be or the timing of sharing (e.g., if you collected human subjects data, you would not want to share fully identified versions of this data publicly). Importantly, these \"unshareable\" study files should never be included in a shareable data package of any type. Leaving these \"unshareable\" study files aside, you still may not want to share all study files in the same way or at the same time: Sharing study files with different levels of protection Sharing study files at different times Managed Access: Your study may have generated sensitive data (e.g., identified human subjects data which you subsequently deidentified, with some level of disclosure risk remaining). In this case, you may want to: share the sensitive data as managed access while sharing study data that are not sensitive (e.g., non-human subject data) or non-data supporting files such as data dictionaries, protocols, and code as open access . Open Access: Your study may have generated only non-sensitive data (e.g., non-human subjects data). In this case, you may want to: share all study data and non-data supporting files such as data dictionaries, protocols, and code as open access . At a later date: Your study group may have not yet published on the study results and/or secured any intellectual property rights applicable to the study, and you may want to wait to share until after reaching these milestones. In this case, you may want to: share certain data, results, or other study documents under embargo, so that they are shared at a later date while perhaps sharing other study files (e.g. certain subsets of data that you will not use to publish , certain subsets of data that do not contain intellectual property, data dictionaries, protocols, and code) without an embargo, so that they are shared now . Now: Your study group may have already published on the data and/or secured any intellectual property rights applicable to the study. In this case, you may want to: share all study data and non-data supporting files such as data dictionaries, protocols, and code without an embargo, so that they are shared now . How and when you want to share all or some of your study files will determine the approach you take to preparing your data package for submission, including what flavor or type of shareable data package you will create, and whether you will create more than one type of shareable data package. Shareable data packages \"flavors\" and when to create them \u00b6 Flavor Description open-access-now A type of shareable data package that only includes study files that you want to share right away (i.e., no embargo or embargo has already expired) and that you have indicated will be shared as open access Share this shareable data package at your data repository as open access without embargo restrictions Data repository users will be able to see/use these files right away with a low barrier Create if: You have at least some study files that you want to share as open access and right away (no embargo) managed-access-now A type of shareable data package that only includes study files that you want to share right away (i.e., no embargo or embargo has already expired) and that you have indicated will be shared as either open access or managed access Share this shareable data package at your data repository as managed access without embargo restrictions Data repository users will be able to begin the process of requesting access right away, and will be able to see/use these files after subsequently completing the (relatively high barrier) process of requesting access in accordance with repository policies Create if: You have at least some study files that you want to share as managed access and right away (no embargo) open-access-by-date A type of shareable data package that includes study files that you want to share right away as well as study files that you will share once a specific date has passed (i.e., under embargo until a specific date in the future) and that you have indicated will be shared as open access Share this shareable data package at your data repository as open access with embargo restrictions Data repository users will be able to see/use these files once the embargo date has passed with a low barrier Create if: You have at least some study files that you want to share as open access but only after a milestone date has been reached (under embargo) managed-access-by-date A type of shareable data package that includes study files that you want to share right away as well as study files that you will share once a specific date has passed (i.e., under embargo until a specific date in the future) and that you have indicated will be shared either as open access or managed access Share this shareable data package at your data repository as managed access with embargo restrictions Data repository users will be able to begin the process of requesting access once the embargo date passes, and will be able to see/use these files after subsequently completing the (relatively high barrier) process of requesting access in accordance with repository policies Create if: You have at least some study files that you want to share as managed access but only after a milestone date has been reached (under embargo) When to create more than one shareable data package \u00b6 Depending on how and when you are sharing your data, you may want to create more than one \"flavor\" of shareable data package for your data. Situations in which you may want to create and share multiple shareable data packages of different \"flavors\" at your data repository include: You want to share some files as open access and some as managed access Because it is easiest and fastest for secondary users to get access to an open-access-now (versus managed-access-now) shareable data package, creating and sharing both an open-access-now and managed-access-now shareable data package maximizes access to your valuable study files. Potential secondary users can access the open-access-now version right away, and this can inform their work plans as they work through the process of gaining authorization to access the managed-access-now version of the shareable data package. You want to share some files right away and others after you've published or secured intellectual property rights Because it will be faster for secondary users to get access to an open-access-now shareable data package (versus open-access-by-date, where the milestone or \"by date\" date, after which the files will be available for sharing, has not yet passed), creating and sharing both an open-access-now and open-access-by-date shareable data package will allow researchers to access some of your data and supporting files now, maximizing access to your valuable study files Create your shareable data package - Overview \u00b6 Creating a shareable data package starts with your local data package, which includes study files plus standard data package metadata. A shareable data package is essentially a \"filtered\" version of your local data package, including only the subset of study files you intend to share, along with all shareable standard data package metadata to provide context, understandability, and navigation to secondary users. Local data package: Make a copy of your local data package directory structure Study files: Filter in a copy of only the study files you've indicated you want to share While creating the standard data package metadata for your local data package, you should have created a Resource Tracker, listing all study files, or a subset of files most relevant to the data or results you are sharing; For each study file/resource listed you should have filled out the \"access\" and \"access date\" fields ( Resource Tracker schema ) Use the values listed for each resource in the \"access\" and \"access date\" fields in your local data package's Resource Tracker to determine which study files should be included in your shareable data package; Files that should be included will depend on the shareable data package flavor For a file to be considered for shareability as part of a shareable data package of any flavor, the file must be listed as a resource in the Resource Tracker, the \"access\" field for that study file/resource is complete and not set to \"permanent private\", and if the \"access\" field has a value of \"temporary private\", the \"access date\" field (which specifies when the file will become shareable) is complete, and there is a second value set in the \"access\" field of either \"open access\" or \"managed access\" (the way you want to share a file once it is no longer temporary private) Standard data package metadata: Standard data package metadata include an Experiment Tracker, a Resource Tracker, one Data Dictionary per tabular data file, and one Results Tracker per publication. Filter in shareable standard data package metadata as below: A copy of the Resource Tracker and Experiment Tracker should be included by default in any shareable data package created. A copy of Results Tracker(s) and Data Dictionary(ies) should only be included in a shareable data package if they are considered shareable based on the flavor of shareable data package you are creating, and the \"access\" and \"access date\" field values set for these files in the local data package Resource Tracker All local file paths to study files/resources listed in the Resource Tracker or any Results Tracker to be included in a shareable data package should be converted to relative file paths for the modified Tracker versions included in any shareable data package - this is to protect the privacy of local computer systems and to make navigation of study files easier for secondary users Finalize your shareable data package for submission - Overview \u00b6 Finalizing your shareable data package for submission starts with your shareable data package(s). Review Shareable Data Package: Review your shareable data package(s) to confirm that you are sharing all study and standard data package metadata files you intend to share and that you are not sharing any files you do not intend to share. Create Accessory Files: Accessory files you'll submit alongside your shareable data package(s) include an \"overview\" Resource Tracker, and a readme file. While your shareable data package(s) will be zip archives and not transparent to secondary users until they download and extract, these accessory files will be submitted as single files that may be viewed/downloaded easily on their own. They are intended to orient potential secondary users to what has been shared in each shareable data package, to provide context that may help potential secondary users to understand if what has been shared will be useful for their purposes, and (if more than one shareable data package has been shared) which shareable data package(s) they may want to access. \"Overview\" Resource Tracker: A copy of the Resource Tracker from your shareable data package with an added column, one per shareable data package you will share, indicating whether or not each file in the Resource Tracker is shared in each shareable data package Readme file: A text file that provides a high level orientation as to what a shareable data package is, what shareable data packages have been shared, and how to use the \"overview\" Resource Tracker to understand what study files have been shared in which shareable data package. This file also contains links back to data packaging and standard data package metadata specifications to aid secondary users in using standard data package metadata to navigate, understand, use, and replicate shared data and results in the shareable data package(s) Zip Shareable Data Package: Zip up your shareable data package(s). Zipping up your shareable data packages creates a single zip file per shareable data package and provides file size compression. You'll submit just one zip file per shareable data package. Submit Shareable Data Package and Accessory Files: Submit your zipped up shareable data package(s) along with your \"overview\" Resource Tracker and readme file accessory files at the data repository you've selected. The full inventory of items you will submit, and under what access conditions to share them at your repository, include: Zipped up shareable data package(s): share each of your zipped up shareable data packages at your data repository with access conditions based on the shareable data package flavor \"Overview\" Resource Tracker: share at your data repository as open access without embargo restrictions Readme file: share at your data repository as open access without embargo restrictions Next steps \u00b6 Decide: Decide what type or flavor of shareable data package(s) it makes sense for your study group to create.

Set yourself up for success \u00b6 In previous steps, you transformed your centralized study folder into a local data package by adding Standard Data Package Metadata . In the instructions that follow, this folder will be referred to as either your \"local data package\" or \"my-study\" folder. Before you begin, you should review a few things to ensure you are ready to prepare your data package for submission. Review the contents of your local data package or \"my-study\" folder. Ensure that all study files and standard data package metadata stored in your dsc-pkg folder (i.e., Resource Tracker, Results Tracker(s), Experiment Tracker, Data Dictionary(ies)) are saved within your centralized study folder. Your study folder may look something like this: Review your Resource Tracker and Results Tracker(s) to ensure that you have annotated all resources that you are planning to share in a repository. Also confirm that: All \"access\" and \"access-date\" fields are filled out completely and in accordance with your plan on how and when to share each resource. Accuracy of these fields will be essential for creating your shareable data package. See the Resource Tracker schema for more information about how to fill out these fields. In addition to all relevant study files/resources, your Results Tracker(s) and Data Dictionary(ies) have been added to your Resource Tracker as resource(s). If your my-study folder looks complete and all resources have been annotated, then you are ready to move to creating shareable data package(s). Create another folder at the same level as your my-study folder. This folder will hold all shareable data package(s) you create, plus the accessory files that you will submit alongside your shareable data package(s) (i.e., an overview Resource Tracker and a README). In the instructions that follow, this folder will be referred to as your \"my-study-share\" folder. Create your 'managed-access-by-date' shareable data package folder \u00b6 Within the my-study-share folder, create a new folder - this will be your shareable data package folder. A name suggestion and convention that we will use here is to call it \"my-study-share-managed-access-by-[YYYY-MM-DD]\". You should replace [YYYY-MM-DD] with the milestone date after which you intend to share the files that will be shared in this shareable data package - i.e. the date after which any embargo on sharing these files will expire. ( Note: In the instructions that follow, this folder will be referred to as your \"shareable data package folder\" ) If your local data package or my-study folder has sub-folders (it will have at least one - i.e., the dsc-pkg folder containing your standard data package metadata) - create sub-folders within your shareable data package folder that reflect the same structure as your local data package or my-study folder. All folders you create here should be empty right now. This is the structure into which you will copy in the files from your local data package or my-study folder once you have determined which files are meant to be shared in your shareable data package folder. For more information on how to decide which files will be copied into this folder, move to the next section. Mirroring the structure of your local data package or my-study folder in your shareable data package folder will allow a secondary user to easily find files referenced in the Resource Tracker by their provided relative file path. Identify resources and standard data package metadata that meet sharing requirements \u00b6 Use the Resource Tracker from your local data package to identify study files/resources and standard data package metadata that meet sharing requirements. The two fields most important to this step are \"access\" and \"access-date.\" You will use the values in these columns to determine which files will go into your shareable data package folder. Identify all study files/resources that are designated as open-access or managed-access as of the milestone date after which any embargo on this shareable data package at a repository will expire. For reference, the requirements for access and access-date are below: \"open-access\" in access AND \"temporary-private\" not in access OR \"open-access\" in access AND \"temporary-private\" in access AND access date <= milestone/embargo expiration date \"managed-access\" in access AND \"temporary-private\" not in access OR \"managed-access\" in access AND \"temporary-private\" in access AND access date <= milestone/embargo expiration date Warning These files should not be copied into your shareable data package folder: A file with an access date after the milestone/embargo expiration date for this shareable data package A file designated as permanent private A file that is not listed in your Resource Tracker In addition to your study files, you will need to identify which standard data package metadata should be copied from the dsc-pkg folder in your local data package/my-study folder into the dsc-pkg folder in your shareable data package. Standard data package metadata includes the Experiment Tracker, Resource Tracker, Results Tracker(s), and Data Dictionary(ies). You should automatically copy the Resource Tracker and Experiment Tracker into any shareable data package you create. These standard data package metadata files are not listed in your Resource Tracker. This is the only exception to the general rule that you should not share any files that are not listed in your Resource Tracker in a shareable data package. Results Tracker(s) and Data Dictionary(ies) have similar restrictions as other study files/resources. Results Tracker(s) and Data Dictionary(ies) should be listed in your Resource Tracker. Use the \"access\" and \"access-date\" fields for your Results Tracker(s) and Data Dictionary(ies) to determine whether they should be copied into your shareable data package, based on the requirements listed above. Copy files that meet sharing requirements into your shareable data package folder \u00b6 After identifying the study files/resources and study-level metadata files that meet the requirements, copy each of those resources and study-level metadata files from your local data package/my-study folder into your shareable data package folder This includes any data or non-data supporting files as well as Results Tracker(s) or Data Dictionary(ies) documented in the Resource Tracker that meet the requirements for sharing at this time (as detailed above) This always includes your Resource Tracker and Experiment Tracker Prepare Resource and Results Trackers \u00b6 Next, you will need to make one adjustment to the Resource Tracker and any Results Tracker(s) in your shareable data package folder. All local file paths to study files/resources listed in the Resource Tracker or any Results Tracker to be included in a shareable data package should be converted to relative file paths for the modified Tracker versions included in any shareable data package. Every path disclosed will be in relation to your dsc-pkg folder. This is to protect the privacy of local computer systems and to make navigation of study files easier for secondary users. As mentioned previously, this method works best when your local data package is centralized (i.e., all study files and your dsc-pkg folder containing standard data package metadata are in a single, centralized local data package or my-study folder). See below for information on which fields in your Resource Tracker or Results Tracker(s) may hold file paths that will need to be adjusted. Reminder: You will be making these adjustments to the Resource Tracker and Results Tracker(s) within your shareable data package folder (copied over from your local data package), not to the versions of these files in your local data package's dsc-pkg folder.

Set yourself up for success \u00b6 In previous steps, you transformed your centralized study folder into a local data package by adding Standard Data Package Metadata . In the instructions that follow, this folder will be referred to as either your \"local data package\" or \"my-study\" folder. Before you begin, you should review a few things to ensure you are ready to prepare your data package for submission. Review the contents of your local data package or \"my-study\" folder. Ensure that all study files and standard data package metadata stored in your dsc-pkg folder (i.e., Resource Tracker, Results Tracker(s), Experiment Tracker, Data Dictionary(ies)) are saved within your centralized study folder. Your study folder may look something like this: Review your Resource Tracker and Results Tracker(s) to ensure that you have annotated all resources that you are planning to share in a repository. Also confirm that: All \"access\" and \"access-date\" fields are filled out completely and in accordance with your plan on how and when to share each resource. Accuracy of these fields will be essential for creating your shareable data package. See the Resource Tracker schema for more information about how to fill out these fields. In addition to all relevant study files/resources, your Results Tracker(s) and Data Dictionary(ies) have been added to your Resource Tracker as resource(s). If your my-study folder looks complete and all resources have been annotated, then you are ready to move to creating shareable data package(s). Create another folder at the same level as your my-study folder. This folder will hold all shareable data package(s) you create, plus the accessory files that you will submit alongside your shareable data package(s) (i.e., an overview Resource Tracker and a README). In the instructions that follow, this folder will be referred to as your \"my-study-share\" folder. Create your 'open-access-now' shareable data package folder \u00b6 Within the my-study-share folder, create a new folder - this will be your shareable data package folder. A name suggestion and convention that we will use here is to call it \"my-study-share-open-access-now\". ( Note: In the instructions that follow, this folder will be referred to as either your \"shareable data package folder\" or \"my-study-share-open-access-now\" folder ) If your local data package or my-study folder has sub-folders (it will have at least one - i.e., the dsc-pkg folder containing your standard data package metadata) - create sub-folders within your shareable data package folder that reflect the same structure as your local data package or my-study folder. All folders you create here should be empty right now. This is the structure into which you will copy in the files from your local data package or my-study folder once you have determined which files are meant to be shared in your shareable data package folder. For more information on how to decide which files will be copied into this folder, move to the next section. Mirroring the structure of your local data package or my-study folder in your shareable data package folder will allow a secondary user to easily find files referenced in the Resource Tracker by their provided relative file path. Identify resources and standard data package metadata that meet sharing requirements \u00b6 Use the Resource Tracker from your local data package to identify study files/resources and standard data package metadata that meet sharing requirements. The two fields most important to this step are \"access\" and \"access-date.\" You will use the values in these columns to determine which files will go into your shareable data package folder. Identify all study files/resources that are designated as open-access as of today's date. For reference, the requirements for access and access-date fields are below: \"open-access\" value in access field AND \"temporary-private\" value not in access field OR \"open-access\" value in access field AND \"temporary-private\" value in access field AND access date <= today's date Warning These files should not be copied into your shareable data package folder: A file with an access date after today's date in your Resource Tracker A file designated as managed access in your Resource Tracker A file designated as permanent private in your Resource Tracker A file that is not listed in your Resource Tracker In addition to your study files, you will need to identify which standard data package metadata should be copied from the dsc-pkg folder in your local data package/my-study folder into the dsc-pkg folder in your shareable data package. Standard data package metadata includes the Experiment Tracker, Resource Tracker, Results Tracker(s), and Data Dictionary(ies). You should automatically copy the Resource Tracker and Experiment Tracker into any shareable data package you create. These standard data package metadata files are not listed in your Resource Tracker. This is the only exception to the general rule that you should not share any files that are not listed in your Resource Tracker in a shareable data package. Results Tracker(s) and Data Dictionary(ies) have similar restrictions as other study files/resources. Results Tracker(s) and Data Dictionary(ies) should be listed in your Resource Tracker. Use the \"access\" and \"access-date\" fields for your Results Tracker(s) and Data Dictionary(ies) to determine whether they should be copied into your shareable data package, based on the requirements listed above. Copy files that meet sharing requirements into your shareable data package folder \u00b6 After identifying the study files/resources and study-level metadata files that meet the requirements, copy each of those resources and study-level metadata files from your local data package/my-study folder into your shareable data package folder This includes any data or non-data supporting files as well as Results Tracker(s) or Data Dictionary(ies) documented in the Resource Tracker that meet the requirements for sharing at this time (as detailed above) This always includes your Resource Tracker and Experiment Tracker Prepare Resource and Results Trackers \u00b6 Next, you will need to make one adjustment to the Resource Tracker and any Results Tracker(s) in your shareable data package folder. All local file paths to study files/resources listed in the Resource Tracker or any Results Tracker to be included in a shareable data package should be converted to relative file paths for the modified Tracker versions included in any shareable data package. Every path disclosed will be in relation to your dsc-pkg folder. This is to protect the privacy of local computer systems and to make navigation of study files easier for secondary users. As mentioned previously, this method works best when your local data package is centralized (i.e., all study files and your dsc-pkg folder containing standard data package metadata are in a single, centralized local data package or my-study folder). See below for information on which fields in your Resource Tracker or Results Tracker(s) may hold file paths that will need to be adjusted. Reminder: You will be making these adjustments to the Resource Tracker and Results Tracker(s) within your shareable data package folder (copied over from your local data package), not to the versions of these files in your local data package's dsc-pkg folder.

Prepare other materials for submission \u00b6 Prepare the accessory files that you will submit along with your shareable data package - This includes the 1) \"Overview\" Resource Tracker, and 2) readme file. Overview Resource Tracker \u00b6 Create a copy of the Resource Tracker in your shareable data package folder and move that copy into your \"my-study-share\" folder. This will be your \"Overview\" Resource Tracker, which will indicate whether or not each file in the Resource Tracker is shared in the shareable data package. Add a column to this Resource Tracker. A suggested name for this column might be \"share-open-access-now.\" For each row, enter a 1 if the file will be shared in this \"open-access-now\" shareable data package. If not shared in this shareable data package, enter a 0. README File \u00b6 Create a readme txt file, which will provide a brief, structured description of the shareable data package(s) included in the \"my-study-share-current-date\" folder. You can find a readme template here . There are three sections in the readme document - Description , Specifications , and Contents . The only section you will need to modify will be the Contents section. There are three sections in the Contents section - readme , resource-tracker , and shareable-data-packages .

Study files/resources \u00b6 All data and non-data supporting files/documents/resources generated by or for or otherwise associated with your study, regardless of whether you are planning to share them. Also known as: study resources, study files, study documents, study artefacts. NOTE: For most studies, study resources will all be files. However for some studies, this may also include (for example) bio samples or other non-file items. Associated Files/Dependencies \u00b6 The term Associated Files/Dependencies may be used with respect to a Resource (i.e. study file/resource ) or with respect to a Result (i.e. results ). Resource When adding a study file/resource to your study's Resource Tracker , you will be asked to supply Associated Files/Dependencies for that study file/resource. An Associated File/Dependency, is any file that the current study file/resource depends on to be interpreted, replicated, or used. For example, consider a processed tabular data file (e.g. a final analytic dataset): A raw data file(s) , plus a code file that merges and cleans the raw data file(s) may be required to replicate the processed tabular data file, and A data dictionary for the processed tabular data file is likely to be required to interpret/use the processed tabular data file. When documenting associated files/dependencies of a resource, only list the files directly underlying or associated with the resource. You will then document each of these associated files/dependencies as resources, only listing the files directly underlying or associated with the resource as associated files/dependencies. Continue documenting in this \"stepping backward\" process until the fields you are listing as associated files/dependencies have no direct associated files/dependencies themselves. Note Data dictionaries and protocols should be shared in the more specific Associated Data Dictionary , Associated Protocol fields in the Resource Tracker wherever possible When adding a publication or report to the Resource Tracker, the only dependency should be the Results Tracker for the publication, and the associated Results Tracker for the publication should be added in the more specific Associated Results Tracker field in the Resource Tracker wherever possible Result When adding a result to your study's Results Tracker , you will be asked to supply Associated Files/Dependencies for that result. An Associated File/Dependency, is any file that the current result depends on to be interpreted, replicated, or used. For example, consider a figure that has been created as a potential candidate for inclusion as Figure 1A (in the context of a Figure 1 with panels A, B, and C) in a draft manuscript: A png or jpg image file exported from Corel Draw or Illustrator may directly underly the whole of Figure 1 (where image files for panel A, B, and C were formatted into a single Figure 1 in the context of a Corel Draw or Illustrator file ); A png or jpg image file produced and written to file by R or python code may directly underly specifically Figure 1A; This image file in turn depends upon the code file that produced it, as well as the data file(s) the code file read in and operated upon to create the final image file; The code file may have been created to implement a specific statistical analysis plan that is laid out in a larger study protocol file , or in a statistical analysis plan file ; The data in the data file may have been collected using a protocol laid out in a specific protocol file , and if the data file(s) underlying the result in 1A is/are tabular data file(s), a data dictionary for the data file(s) is likely to be required to interpret/use the data file(s) When listing Associated Files/Dependencies for a result in the Results Tracker, including only the Associated Files/Dependencies directly underlying the result. In the above example, that would mean documenting only the png or jpg image file underlying Figure 1. You would then document the png or jpg image file as a resource in the Resource Tracker, including only the associated files/dependencies directly underlying the resource (i.e., png or jpg image file underlying Figure 1A, specifically). Continue this \"stepping backwards\" process documenting resources in the Resource Tracker until the files you are listing as associated files/dependencies have no direct associated files/dependencies themselves. Associated Data Dictionary \u00b6 The Data Dictionary that inventories and provides detailed information regarding all variables in the specific tabular data file for which it is the Associated Data Dictionary. Associated Protocol \u00b6 The protocol that provides detailed information regarding the procedure followed to produce the data contained in the specific tabular data file for which it is the Associated Protocol. Associated Results Tracker \u00b6 The Results Tracker that inventories and provides detailed information regarding all results (e.g. figures, figure panels, tables, text statements) shared in the specific publication or report for which it is the Associated Results Tracker. Results \u00b6 A figure, figure panel, table, or text statement that communicates a result and is, will, or may be shared in the context of a publication, report or presentation dsc-pkg Folder \u00b6 A file folder/directory that will hold all of the Standard Data Package Metadata Files for your Data Package . It is generally recommended that you create a single overarching study file folder/directory to hold all study files and folders and that you create your dsc-pkg folder as a direct sub-directory of your study folder and name it \"dsc-pkg\". Standard data package metadata files \u00b6 Standard metadata file types that, altogether, provide essential usability and context information about the study as a whole and about the data files your study has produced/collected. These metadata files should be included in all data packages . They should be stored together in a single file directory, preferably as a sub-directory within your study file directory called \"dsc-pkg\". See below for an example directory structure. NOTE : All standard data package metadata files have a standardized csv format in which they should be completed and provided. See here for csv templates and schemas/field definitions to aid you in completing the templates.

Please follow the links below for additional information on: Standard data package metadata files Standard data package metadata files - File-level Results Tracker overview Results Tracker csv template Results Tracker schema/field definitions Minimal annotation \u00b6 When completing the Resource Tracker for your study : Minimal annotation implies that you will list and annotate relevant study resources in the resource tracker ONLY if you will share those files in a public data repository When completing the Resource Tracker you will NOT list and annotate relevant study files if they will not be shared in a public data repository See the alternative: Wholistic Annotation Advantages You only catalog the data and non-data supporting files that you will share/submit to a repository. Especially if you are late in your study, Minimal Annotation may be less time consuming than the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), because you are listing and annotating fewer files (i.e. only the files that will be shared , versus all files that will be shared AND all files that will NOT be shared) in the Resource Tracker for your study. This approach still provides a lot of value to researchers who may find your study - It will help them to parse what the study was trying to do, how the study was designed, what has been made available, whether or not the data that has been made available may be useful for their purposes (e.g. secondary data analysis, comparison to their own results, etc.), and even whether it may be useful to reach out to the study group of origin to request data that has not been provided or to set up a formal collaboration. This approach allows you to fulfill minimal data sharing requirements. Caveats As compared to the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), you don\u2019t get the full local annotation benefit that would come with fully cataloguing all data and non-data/supporting files relevant to a study (including files you will not share/submit to a repository), and how they relate to each other and to published results \u2013 these benefits include facilitating continuity and passed-down knowledge within study groups , and discovery, sharing, and re-use of the data and knowledge produced by the study outside of the original study group. As compared to the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), you may not get the full benefit of added study discoverability and transparencty for potential secondary data users and collaborators that the Resource Tracker can provide. Wholistic annotation \u00b6 When completing the Resource Tracker for your study : Wholistic annotation implies that you will list and annotate relevant study resources without regard for whether (or not) you will share those files in a public data repository When completing the Resource Tracker you will list and annotate relevant study files that will be shared AND those that will NOT be shared When listing/annotating a file that will NOT be shared, access level should be set to \"permanent-private\" to indicate that the file will not be shared See the alternative: Minimal Annotation Advantages Maximizes transparency and allows other researchers interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project and the data when accessing study documentation. Allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by another researcher. You get the benefit of full local annotation, which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study. Documenting and sharing all metadata associated with your study can increase the discoverability of your study. Caveats Especially if you are late in your study, Wholistic Annotation may be more time consuming than the alternative (Minimal Annotation), because you are listing and annotating more files (i.e. files that will be shared AND files that will NOT be shared, versus ONLY files that will be shared) in the Resource Tracker for your study. Finding your study's best fit annotation approach For guidance on determining the best fit annotation approach for your study group , see the best fit questions . As-you-go annotation \u00b6 As-you-go annotation implies that you will begin the data packaging and annotation process right away; you will audit and annotate all study resources already created, and keep up with annotation as you move through the remainder of your study timeline; you will generally audit and annotate all study resources regardless of whether these resources will ultimately be shared at a public data repository ( \"wholistic\" annotation ) See the alternative: Top-down Annotation Advantages Spreads out annotation and data packaging work across the course of the study so that burden at the end of the stusy is minimal. You get the benefit of full local annotation, which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study.

Documenting and sharing all metadata associated with your study can increase the discoverability of your study. Caveats The \"as-you-go\" annotation approach, **when applied broadly as outlined above** is strongly recommended for study groups that are early on in their study as the burden of starting up is relatively light when few study files/resources have so far been collected or produced by or for the study. However, the start up burden of this approach may be quite substantial for studies groups that are late or even well into their study and have already accumulated many study files/resources, and we generally recommend these groups consider the alternative, more goal-focused and narrow annotation approach: Top-down annotation. **The \"as-you-go\" annotation approach may also be applied in a narrower sense**, especially by study groups that are later in their study and who will not apply the \"as-you-go\" annotation approach in the broadest sense. This implies that studies will consider the whole packaging overview process and complete items as they can, as opposed to waiting until the very end (for example, when they are about to submit a study manuscript for peer review) to start the process. Some examples include, 1) auditing study files for tabular data files, creating data dictionaries for existing tabular data files right away, and creating data dictionaries right away for new tabular data files as the study collects or produces them, 2) annotating results the study group knows will or likely will be included in a final manuscript as they are produced, and creating a results tracker for final manuscript documents as drafts begin to be forumulated by the study group, 3) annotating component experiments and other activities that are part of the study right away if already designed, or as soon as they are designed (especially if it is clear that the experiment or activity will or likely will produce data that will be used to support/produce results that will be included in a final manuscript). Finding your study's best fit annotation approach For guidance on determining the best fit annotation approach for your study group , see the best fit questions . Top-down annotation \u00b6 Top-down annotation implies that you will generally implement the data packaging and annotation process in a somewhat narrower, more goal-oriented manner as compared to how you would implement if using the alternative As-you-go annotation approach; You will generally determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation), then wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the publication containing a set of results for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating); you will then audit and annotate the subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the results or dataset already created, and annotate this subset of study resources right away; when you take the \"top down\" annotation approach, you will generally audit the full subset of study resources required to support your result(s) and/or dataset regardless of whether these resources will ultimately be shared at a public data repository, however you may choose to 1) annotate all resources in this subset regardless of whether they will be shared in a public repository ( \"wholistic\" annotation ), or 2) annotate only the resources in this subset that will be shared in a public repository ( \"minimal\" annotation ) See the alternative: As-you-go Annotation Advantages \"Top-down\" annotation allows for a narrower and more goal-focused approach to annotation and data-sharing as compared to the alternative \"As-you-go\" annotation; This approach may be very appealing to study groups that are well into their study as it reduces annotation and data sharing burden by focusing on producing the essential annotation needed to ensure that the results or datasets they share are discoverable, interpretable, reusable, and replicable by researchers and other potential collaborators. Concentrates annotation and data packaging work at the end of the study which allows singular focus on the task and may speed the process. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, you get the benefit of full local annotation of the files underlying your study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset), which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study. Even if you choose to use \"minimal\" annotation with the \"top down\" approach you still get the benefit of some local annotation to support preserving institutional knowledge within your study group. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, you maximize transparency and allow other researchers interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project and the data that explicitly underlies your study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) when accessing study documentation. Even if you choose to use \"minimal\" annotation with the \"top down\" approach you still provide a lot of transparency about what data and non-data supporting files you are sharing to support your study's goal data sharing product, how these files relate to each other and how to use and interpret these files; this presents a huge value to potential secondary data users or collaborators. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, this still allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility, interpretability and use of the study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by another researcher. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, this allows for documenting and sharing all metadata associated with the study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) and this can increase the discoverability of your study. Caveats With \"top-down\" annotation, your study team will not have the benefits of full local annotation. If there are any data/files that were not included in a manuscript's results, then they will not be documented for your study team's reference. Future publications on this data, with similar sharing requirements, will not be able to draw on an existing fully documented inventory of study files and resources. \"Top-down\" annotation is necessarily more narrow and goal-focused than \"As-you-go,\" which means that someone accessing your study on a repository will get a focused view of a specific set of results or a key dataset associated with your study. This focused view is helpful for understanding your published results, but does not give researchers insight into the full picture of the study. For example, it may be very useful for researchers conducting similar studies to be able to review and learn from negative data, where an experiment did not acheive the desired result. Finding your study's best fit annotation approach For guidance on determining the best fit annotation approach for your study group , see the best fit questions . Data Package \u00b6 A data package is made up of your study files and the Standard Data Package Metadata, a set of metadata files that describe your study, study files and results, and study file and results relationships. Shareable Data Package \u00b6 A shareable data package is a zip archive produced locally that is ready to be submitted to a repository. A shareable data package includes only files to be shared to a repository. There are multiple \"flavors\" of shareable data package depending on how and when files are designated to be shared: open-access now open-access-by-date (i.e., embargoed through a specific date) managed-access now managed-access-by-date (i.e.,embargoed through a specific date) Data-sharing Orientation \u00b6 A study group's goal(s) for data-sharing. People will have different goals in sharing data and non-data supporting files/resources from their study. These goals, or 'orientations' may be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, study staff resources and time constraints, investigator preference, and requirements imposed by a funder, journal, or other entity somehow governing the study. Determining what your goals are for data sharing will help guide you in determining what you will include in your data package and how and when you will annotate the data and non-data supporting files/resources in your data package. There are two main data-sharing \"orientations.\" These data sharing goals or \"orientations\" are not mutually exclusive. You may choose both Results-support and Dataset-sharing as goals for your study's data sharing goal. Results-support \u00b6 The study group wants to share data and non-data supporting files specifically to support results shared in a published manuscript or other venue (e.g. presentation, poster, report, etc.) They will share items required to interpret, replicate, or use these results Dataset-sharing \u00b6 The study group wants to share a specific dataset(s); perhaps the group has collected/created a very rich dataset and used this dataset to ask and publish results related to specific scientific questions; they believe other study groups may be able to leverage this dataset to ask and publish results related to other scientific questions that may be related or unrelated to the questions the dataset was originally collected to help investigate The study group wants to share this specific dataset(s), as well as the data and non-data supporting files specifically to support use of this dataset(s) They will share items required to interpret, replicate, or use this dataset(s)","title":"Terms and Concepts"},{"location":"terms/#terms-and-concepts","text":"","title":"Terms and Concepts"},{"location":"terms/#tabular-data-file","text":"A data file that is organized in a table with rows and columns.","title":"Tabular data file"},{"location":"terms/#study-filesresources","text":"All data and non-data supporting files/documents/resources generated by or for or otherwise associated with your study, regardless of whether you are planning to share them. Also known as: study resources, study files, study documents, study artefacts. NOTE: For most studies, study resources will all be files. However for some studies, this may also include (for example) bio samples or other non-file items.","title":"Study files/resources"},{"location":"terms/#associated-filesdependencies","text":"The term Associated Files/Dependencies may be used with respect to a Resource (i.e. study file/resource ) or with respect to a Result (i.e. results ). Resource When adding a study file/resource to your study's Resource Tracker , you will be asked to supply Associated Files/Dependencies for that study file/resource. An Associated File/Dependency, is any file that the current study file/resource depends on to be interpreted, replicated, or used. For example, consider a processed tabular data file (e.g. a final analytic dataset): A raw data file(s) , plus a code file that merges and cleans the raw data file(s) may be required to replicate the processed tabular data file, and A data dictionary for the processed tabular data file is likely to be required to interpret/use the processed tabular data file. When documenting associated files/dependencies of a resource, only list the files directly underlying or associated with the resource. You will then document each of these associated files/dependencies as resources, only listing the files directly underlying or associated with the resource as associated files/dependencies. Continue documenting in this \"stepping backward\" process until the fields you are listing as associated files/dependencies have no direct associated files/dependencies themselves. Note Data dictionaries and protocols should be shared in the more specific Associated Data Dictionary , Associated Protocol fields in the Resource Tracker wherever possible When adding a publication or report to the Resource Tracker, the only dependency should be the Results Tracker for the publication, and the associated Results Tracker for the publication should be added in the more specific Associated Results Tracker field in the Resource Tracker wherever possible Result When adding a result to your study's Results Tracker , you will be asked to supply Associated Files/Dependencies for that result. An Associated File/Dependency, is any file that the current result depends on to be interpreted, replicated, or used. For example, consider a figure that has been created as a potential candidate for inclusion as Figure 1A (in the context of a Figure 1 with panels A, B, and C) in a draft manuscript: A png or jpg image file exported from Corel Draw or Illustrator may directly underly the whole of Figure 1 (where image files for panel A, B, and C were formatted into a single Figure 1 in the context of a Corel Draw or Illustrator file ); A png or jpg image file produced and written to file by R or python code may directly underly specifically Figure 1A; This image file in turn depends upon the code file that produced it, as well as the data file(s) the code file read in and operated upon to create the final image file; The code file may have been created to implement a specific statistical analysis plan that is laid out in a larger study protocol file , or in a statistical analysis plan file ; The data in the data file may have been collected using a protocol laid out in a specific protocol file , and if the data file(s) underlying the result in 1A is/are tabular data file(s), a data dictionary for the data file(s) is likely to be required to interpret/use the data file(s) When listing Associated Files/Dependencies for a result in the Results Tracker, including only the Associated Files/Dependencies directly underlying the result. In the above example, that would mean documenting only the png or jpg image file underlying Figure 1. You would then document the png or jpg image file as a resource in the Resource Tracker, including only the associated files/dependencies directly underlying the resource (i.e., png or jpg image file underlying Figure 1A, specifically).

People will have different goals in sharing data and non-data supporting files/resources from their study. These goals, or 'orientations' may be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, study staff resources and time constraints, investigator preference, and requirements imposed by a funder, journal, or other entity somehow governing the study. Determining what your goals are for data sharing will help guide you in determining what you will include in your data package and how and when you will annotate the data and non-data supporting files/resources in your data package. There are two main data-sharing \"orientations.\" These data sharing goals or \"orientations\" are not mutually exclusive.
