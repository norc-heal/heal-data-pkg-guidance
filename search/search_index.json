This type of annotation works best paired with 'as you go' annotation , as it easier an less time consuming to annotate wholistically, retrospectively, as part of 'top-down' annotation . Although this mode of annotation is more time consuming, it maximizes transparency and allows investigators interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project when accessing study documentation on the Platform. This structure also allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by an investigator. Who may choose to share this way Study groups that have not started collecting data or are very early in the data collection process. Study groups that are earlier in the process and are interested in understanding and implementing a file and folder structure that facilitates data sharing in the future. Study groups that want to maximise the amount of information that they share about their study. Pros to sharing this way You get the benefit of full local annotation, which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study. Although more time consuming at the beginning, integration of this process into your workflows allows for documentation and annotation in parts as you move through the study, so that you do not need to compile all that information at the end of the study, retrospectively. Documenting and sharing all metadata associated with your study can increase the discoverability of your study. Cons to sharing this way More time consuming, because it requires you to set up the structures to fully catalogue all data and non-data/supporting files that are relevant to your study. Notes about wholistic annotation If you are early in your study and choose to pursue wholistic annotation, we recommend you consider reviewing and implementing [HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming of study artefacts]. This will ease the process of annotation as well as future data sharing. If you are annotating wholistically, you will also document dependencies 'one-layer-deep'. For more information, see Resource Tracker: Associated Files/Dependencies and 'One Layer Deep' Dependencies . Minimal annotation of study artefacts \u00b6 Minimal annotation starts with the main file you are focused on sharing, whether that is a multi-result file, such as a publication or presentation, or a dataset, and works backwards. Rather than documenting all files, you document only the data and non-data file dependencies required to reproduce the final results or dataset. This is likely more ideal for studies that may be close to data collection completion and are not focused on meeting data sharing requirements but do not have adequate funding or time to devote the complete documentation of the data. This type of annotation pairs well with \u2018top-down\u2019 annotation , which retrospectively annotates study artefacts. Who may choose to share this way Study groups that may be finished or close to finished collecting data and have already produced results files (e.g., figures, draft publications/NIH reports, etc.) Study groups that want to meet minimal data sharing requirements of sharing data underlying published results Pros to sharing this way You only catalog the data and non-data/supporting files that you will share/submit to a repository. This is less work than fully cataloguing all data and non-data/supporting files relevant to a study (including files you will not share/submit to a repository), especially if the study is well underway or complete/nearing completion and/or does not have resources or time set aside for a complete file inventory.

If you are early on in your study and all component study experiments/activities are already known/designed, go ahead and complete the experiment tracker right away. If you are early on in your study and all component study experiments/activities are NOT already known/designed, you may want to consider starting your experiment tracker right away, adding the experiments/activities that are already known/designed, and then moving forward add each new experiment/activity as it is designed (\"as you go\" annotation). If you are later on in your study, you may want to consider using your experiment tracker to inventory a specific subset of study experiments/activities instead of all study experiments/activities; specifically, you may want to wait until you are at the study stage of producing the result(s) and/or dataset(s) your study group aims to share before starting your experiment tracker; this will allow you to pick and choose, adding only the experiments/activities that produced items that support the result(s) or dataset(s) you will share. Resource Tracker : Each study should create and complete a resource tracker; it is meant to be an inventory of each data or non-data supporting file collected/produced by or for the study, plus all standard data package metadata files added during the data packaging process. If you are early on in your study, you may want to consider starting your resource tracker right away, adding the study files/resources that have already been created, and then moving forward, adding each new study file/resource as it is created (\"as you go\" annotation). If you are later on in your study, you may want to wait until you are at the study stage of producing the result(s) and/or dataset(s) your study group aims to share before starting your resource tracker; this will allow you to pick and choose, adding only the study resources/files that that support the result(s) or dataset(s) you will share.","title":"Add Standard data package metadata (Study-level) - when, and how"},{"location":"fit/guidance-1/#find-the-best-fit-for-you","text":"See here for some guidance on determining the best fit for your study group","title":"Find the best fit for you"},{"location":"fit/index-archive/","text":"When deciding how you will share and annotate your study data, you should consider two key questions . What is your orientation towards data sharing? How far along are you in your study? 1. What is your orientation towards data sharing? \u00b6 Determining what your goals are for data sharing will help guide you in determining what you will include in your future data package and how you will annotate the data and non-data/supporting documents in your dat package. People will have different goals in sharing their study data, which can be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, resources and time constraints, and investigator preference. There are two main \"data sharing orientations.\" They are not mutually exclusive. See more about each data sharing orientation below. Results-support This orientation is for investigators who are interested only in fulfilling the requirement to share the data that is necessary to reproduce their results. Example Your study is complete, and you have very limited time or resources budgeted for data sharing. You have published a manuscript on your results or are in the process of submitting one. You want to fulfill the minimum data sharing requirements, so you will only share the data required to reproduce the manuscript results. Dataset-oriented This orientation is for investigators who are interested in sharing a specific set of data or as much data as possible so that other researchers can get additional value from them, such as conducting additional research and analyes beyond the original study's focus. Example Your study is collecting RNA expression data. You are only focusing on a small subset of the collected data for your study, but you would like to be able to share as much of this data as possible so that other investigators can comb through the rich data for other analyses and insight. 2. How far along are you in your study? \u00b6 Where you are in your study when you start to think about data sharing will affect how you document your data.

If you are later in your study, you may want to wait until you are at the study stage of producing the result(s) and/or dataset(s) your study group aims to share before auditing your study files AND you may want to audit only files that are needed to support (e.g. interpret, use, or replicate) results you will share in a manuscript, or datasets you will share in a public data repository. Organize and consistently name your files and folders \u00b6 Variations: follow HEAL recommendations for organization and naming of study files/resources, or not If you are early in your study, you may want to consider following HEAL recommendations and guidance re: file naming and organization. In order to do this, you may need to change the location of and rename files. You should start this process right away in order to establish file naming and organizational conventions that you can apply to all study files as they are created/produced. Establishing file naming and organizational conventions based on HEAL recommendations early in your study may increase human interpretability of your files and file structure and make it easier especially to create and complete your data package's Resource Tracker. If you are late in your study, applying HEAL recommendations and guidance re: file naming and organization may be too burdensome to be realistic and it may make more sense to leave naming and organization as is. Add Standard data package metadata (File-level) \u00b6 Variations: If, when, and how Currently, file-level standard data package metadata files are the data dictionary (heal-formatted-data-dictionary; one per tabular data file) and the results tracker (heal-formatted-results-tracker; one per multi-result file - e.g. manuscript, poster). Data Dictionary : If your study has not and will not produce any tabular data files, you will not need to create a data dictionary. If your study has or will produce any tabular data files, you will need to create a data dictionary per tabular data file (if multiple tabular data files have the same format with the same variables, you can create a single data dictionary that applies across all of these files). In many cases, the best approach nearly universally will be to go ahead and create a data dictionary for each of your tabular datasets as the dataset is created. Please see here [add link to cli tools and/or desktop tool approach] for instructions on how to create (or at least get a head start on creating) a HEAL formatted data dictionary using just your tabular data file as input. Results Tracker : If your study is interested in providing clear support for results you share in a manuscript (required by many journals and funding agen cies), you should create a results tracker. If you are late in your study and have already produced/published a manuscript or result(s) in another format (e.g. poster, white paper, NIH report), you may want to consider starting your results tracker right away. If you are early in your study and have not yet formulated final results text, tables or figures or drafted you may want to consider waiting to start your results tracker until you have reached the study stage of formulating final results text, tables, or figures. If your study is most interested in sharing a dataset of general interest to the scientific/research community, and is less interested in specifically providing clear support for results you share in a manuscript, you may not need to create a results tracker. Add Standard data package metadata (Study-level) - when, and how \u00b6 Variations: When, and how Currently, study-level standard data package metadata files are the experiment tracker (heal-formatted-experiment-tracker; one per study) and the resource tracker (heal-formatted-resource-tracker; one per study). Experiment Tracker : Each study should create and complete an experiment tracker; it is meant to be an inventory of each component experiment or activity that is part of your study. It is expected that some studies (e.g. clinical trials) may have just a single component study experiment/activity, whereas others may have many (e.g. many basic science studies). If you are early on in your study and all component study experiments/activities are already known/designed, go ahead and complete the experiment tracker right away. If you are early on in your study and all component study experiments/activities are NOT already known/designed, you may want to consider starting your experiment tracker right away, adding the experiments/activities that are already known/designed, and then moving forward add each new experiment/activity as it is designed (\"as you go\" annotation). If you are later on in your study, you may want to wait until you are at the study stage of producing the result(s) and/or dataset(s) your study group aims to share before starting your experiment tracker; this will allow you to pick and choose, adding only the experiments/activities that produced items that support the result(s) or dataset(s) you will share. Resource Tracker : Each study should create and complete a resource tracker; it is meant to be an inventory of each data or non-data supporting file collected/produced by or for the study, plus all standard data package metadata files added during the data packaging process.

Data Dictionary : If your study has not and will not produce any tabular data files, you will not need to create a data dictionary. If your study has or will produce any tabular data files, you will need to create a data dictionary per tabular data file (if multiple tabular data files have the same format with the same variables, you can create a single data dictionary that applies across all of these files). In many cases, the best approach nearly universally will be to go ahead and create a data dictionary for each of your tabular datasets as the dataset is created. Please see here [add link to cli tools and/or desktop tool approach] for instructions on how to create (or at least get a head start on creating) a HEAL formatted data dictionary using just your tabular data file as input. Results Tracker : If your study is interested in providing clear support for results you share in a manuscript (required by many journals and funding agen cies), you should create a results tracker. If you are late in your study and have already produced/published a manuscript or result(s) in another format (e.g. poster, white paper, NIH report), you may want to consider starting your results tracker right away.

People will have different goals in sharing their study data, which can be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, resource and time constraints, and investigator preference. There are three main orientations. You do not have to pick just one of these orientations, although results-support is more likely to stand alone. For example, investigators may be interested in sharing a specific dataset in addition to data on their materials and methods. See more about each data sharing orientation below. Results-support This orientation is for investigators who are interested only in fulfilling the requirement to share the data that is necessary to reproduce their results. Example Your study is complete, and you have very limited time or resources budgeted for data sharing. You have published a manuscript on your results or are in the process of submitting one. You want to fulfill the minimum data sharing requirements, so you will only share the data required to reproduce the manuscript results. If this best describes your data sharing orientation, click [here](resultsupp.md). Dataset-oriented This orientation is for investigators who are interested in sharing a specific set of data or as much data as possible so that other researchers can get additional value from them, such as conducting additional research and analyes beyond the original study's focus. Example Your study is collecting RNA expression data. You are only focusing on a small subset of the collected data for your study, but you would like to be able to share as much of this data as possible so that other investigators can comb through the rich data for other analyses and insight. If this best describes your data sharing orientation, click here. Materials- and methods-oriented This orientation is for investigators who are inteersted in sharing inforamtion about their materials and methods that would allow others to reproduce or build upon them in future research. Example Your study is building an organ-on-a-chip model. You want to share information about the formulation of the chip and results demonstrating that the chip performs similarly as the organ in vivo, so that other investigators can understand the process and reassemble and build upon your successful model in future research.

Especially if you are late in your study, Minimal Annotation may be less time consuming than the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), because you are listing and annotating fewer files (i.e. only the files that will be shared , versus all files that will be shared AND all files that will NOT be shared) in the Resource Tracker for your study. This approach still provides a lot of value to researchers who may find your study - It will help them to parse what the study was trying to do, how the study was designed, what has been made available, whether or not the data that has been made available may be useful for their purposes (e.g. secondary data analysis, comparison to their own results, etc.), and even whether it may be useful to reach out to the study group of origin to request data that has not been provided or to set up a formal collaboration. This approach allows you to fulfill minimal data sharing requirements. Caveats As compared to the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), you don\u2019t get the full local annotation benefit that would come with fully cataloguing all data and non-data/supporting files relevant to a study (including files you will not share/submit to a repository), and how they relate to each other and to published results \u2013 these benefits include facilitating continuity and passed-down knowledge within study groups , and discovery, sharing, and re-use of the data and knowledge produced by the study outside of the original study group. As compared to the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), you may not get the full benefit of added study discoverability and transparencty for potential secondary data users and collaborators that the Resource Tracker can provide. Wholistic annotation \u00b6 When completing the Resource Tracker for your study : Wholistic annotation implies that you will list and annotate relevant study resources without regard for whether (or not) you will share those files in a public data repository When completing the Resource Tracker you will list and annotate relevant study files that will be shared AND those that will NOT be shared When listing/annotating a file that will NOT be shared, access level should be set to \"permanent-private\" to indicate that the file will not be shared See the alternative: Minimal Annotation Advantages Maximizes transparency and allows other researchers interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project and the data when accessing study documentation. allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by another researcher. You get the benefit of full local annotation, which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study. Documenting and sharing all metadata associated with your study can increase the discoverability of your study. Caveats Especially if you are late in your study, Wholistic Annotation may be more time consuming than the alternative (Minimal Annotation), because you are listing and annotating more files (i.e. files that will be shared AND files that will NOT be shared, versus ONLY files that will be shared) in the Resource Tracker for your study. As-you-go annotation \u00b6 As-you-go annotation implies that you will begin the data packaging and annotation process right away; you will audit and annotate all study resources already created, and keep up with annotation as you move through the remainder of your study timeline; you will generally audit and annotate all study resources regardless of whether these resources will ultimately be shared at a public data repository ( \"wholistic\" annotation ) See the alternative: Top-down Annotation As you move through the data packaging process steps , \"as-you-go\" annotation implies that you will : Audit relevant files start this right away audit all files/resources already collected or produced by or for your study determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) Organize and consistently name your files and folders start this right away consider using HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources to establish naming and organization conventions that should be followed for all study files, including for files that already exist and for new study files/resources as they are collected or produced align file name/organization of existing study files to the conventions you established in the step above - this may require you to change file names and locations for already-existing files (NOTE: do not duplicate files in order to align with name/org conventions as this may lead to confusion down the road as to which copy is the \"source of truth\") Add Standard data package metadata - File-level Data Dictionary start this right away audit existing study files to identify any tabular data files that may have already been collected or produced by or for the study create a data dictionary for any existing tabular data files right away if/when any new tabular data files are collected or produced by or for the study, create a data dictionary for the new tabular data file(s) right away and save them using file name and organization conventions you have established for your study (see step 2 above) Results Tracker start this right away : determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) wait until your study is at the point of producing final result products (e.g. figures, tables, text statements) once your study has reached this point, and if your study has determined that a data sharing goal of the study is to provide results-support , start annotating final result products right away, even if you have not formally begun to add them to a multi-result file as new final result products are produced by your study, annotate each final result product right away once your study has started to formally add final result products to a multi-result file(s), start adding result annotation files you've already produced (in the step just above) to a results tracker document for the multi-result file(s) - one results tracker per multi-result file as new multi-result files are produced by your study, use the result annotation files you create for each final result product in the multi-result file to create a results tracker document for the new multi-result file Add Standard data package metadata - Study-level Experiment Tracker start this right away audit all component experiments or other activities that will be part of your study start annotating study component experiments or activities that have already been designed if/when any new study component experiments or activities are designed, annotate each new study component experiment or activity right away Resource Tracker start this right away audit all files/resources already collected or produced by or for your study (see step 1 above) establish file naming and organization conventions for your study files and make any necessary adjustments to current study file naming/organization to align with these conventions (see step 2 above) systematically annotate all files/resources already collected or produced by or for your study right away once you've annotated all files/resources already produced by or for your study, add these resource annotation files to your resource tracker as new files/resources are collected or produced by or for your study, save them using the file naming and organization conventions you established previously, and annotate each new resource right away Advantages Spreads out annotation and data packaging work across the course of the study so that burden at the end of the stusy is minimal. You get the benefit of full local annotation, which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study. Maximizes transparency and allows other researchers interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project and the data when accessing study documentation. Allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by another researcher. Documenting and sharing all metadata associated with your study can increase the discoverability of your study. Caveats The \"as-you-go\" annotation approach, **when applied broadly as outlined above** is strongly recommended for study groups that are early on in their study as the burden of starting up is relatively light when few study files/resources have so far been collected or produced by or for the study. However, the start up burden of this approach may be quite substantial for studies groups that are late or even well into their study and have already accumulated many study files/resources, and we generally recommend these groups consider the alternative, more goal-focused and narrow annotation approach: [Top-down annotation](#top-down-annotation). **The \"as-you-go\" annotation approach may also be applied in a narrower sense**, especially by study groups that are later in their study and who will not apply the \"as-you-go\" annotation approach in the broadest sense. This implies that studies will consider the whole packaging overview process and complete items as they can, as opposed to waiting until the very end (for example, when they are about to submit a study manuscript for peer review) to start the process. Some examples include, 1) auditing study files for tabular data files, creating data dictionaries for existing tabular data files right away, and creating data dictionaries right away for new tabular data files as the study collects or produces them, 2) annotating final result products the study group knows will or likely will be included in a final manuscript as they are produced, and creating a results tracker for final manuscript documents as drafts begin to be forumulated by the study group, 3) annotating component experiments and other activities that are part of the study right away if already designed, or as soon as they are designed (especially if it is clear that the experiment or activity will or likely will produce data that will be used to support/produce final result products that will be included in a final manuscript). Top-down annotation \u00b6 Top-down annotation implies that you will generally implement the data packaging and annotation process in a somewhat narrower, more goal-oriented manner as compared to how you would implement if using the alternative As-you-go annotation approach; You will generally determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation), then wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the final result product(s) or manuscripts containing a set of final result product(s) for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating); you will then audit and annotate the subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the results or dataset already created, and annotate this subset of study resources right away; when you take the \"top down\" annotation approach, you will generally audit the full subset of study resources required to support your result(s) and/or dataset regardless of whether these resources will ultimately be shared at a public data repository, however you may choose to 1) annotate all resources in this subset regardless of whether they will be shared in a public repository ( \"wholistic\" annotation ), or 2) annotate only the resources in this subset that will be shared in a public repository ( \"minimal\" annotation ) See the alternative: As-you-go Annotation As you move through the data packaging process steps , \"top-down\" annotation implies that you will : Audit relevant files start this right away : determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the final result product(s) or manuscripts containing a set of final result product(s) for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating) audit the full subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the goal sharing product(s) (i.e. final study result product(s)/manuscipt(s) or dataset) Organize and consistently name your files and folders start this right away : determine if you are early in your study if you are early in your study: consider using HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources to establish naming and organization conventions that should be followed for all study files, including for files that already exist and for new study files/resources as they are collected or produced align file name/organization of existing study files to the conventions you established in the step above - this may require you to change file names and locations for already-existing files (NOTE: do not duplicate files in order to align with name/org conventions as this may lead to confusion down the road as to which copy is the \"source of truth\") if you are late in your study: we generally recommend that you leave file names and organization as is you may use the approach laid out above for those early in their study, however if you are late in your study and have accumulated many study files already, establishing file naming and organization conventions now and back-applying them may be quite burdensome and potentially prone to error if you have sets of \"like\" files (e.g. a similarly formatted tabular data file or brain imaging file per study subject per study timepoint), it may be well worth establishing file naming and organization conventions based on HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources now and back-applying them just for these file sets - doing so will make it possible/easier to annotate these file sets in one go instead of annotating them singly one at a time, and so may substantially reduce annotation/data-sharing burden for the study group Add Standard data package metadata - File-level Data Dictionary start this right away : determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the final result product(s) or manuscripts containing a set of final result product(s) for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating) audit the full subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the goal sharing product(s) (i.e. final study result product(s)/manuscipt(s) or dataset) among this subset of files, identify any tabular data files create a data dictionary for these tabular data files right away Results Tracker start this right away : determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) wait until your study is at the point of producing final result products (e.g. figures, tables, text statements) once your study has reached this point, and if your study has determined that a data sharing goal of the study is to provide results-support , start annotating final result products right away that are likely to be included in a final manuscript or other multi-result file you will share and for which you would like to provide results-support, even if you have not formally begun to add them to a multi-result file as new final result products are produced by your study, annotate each final result product right away once your study has started to formally add final result products to a multi-result file(s), start adding result annotation files you've already produced (in the step just above) to a results tracker document for the multi-result file(s) - one results tracker per multi-result file as new multi-result files are produced by your study, use the result annotation files you create for each final result product in the multi-result file to create a results tracker document for the new multi-result file alternatively, you may wait until your study is at the point of a final manuscript or other multi-result file for which you would like to provide results-support; then start annotating only the final result products that are positively contained in this multi-result file Add Standard data package metadata - Study-level Experiment Tracker start this right away OR wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product audit all component experiments or other activities that are or will be part of your study identify the subset of component experiments or other activities that positively produced or are likely to produce data or other products that are required to interpret, use, or reproduce your goal data sharing product (i.e. final result product(s), manuscripts, or a dataset you want to share/disseminate) start annotating this subset of study component experiments or activities if they have already been designed if/when any new study component experiments or activities are designed and it is determined that the new experiment/activity produced or is likely to produce data or other products that are required to interpret, use, or reproduce your goal data sharing product, annotate this new study component experiment(s) or activity(s) right away Resource Tracker wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. final result product(s), manuscripts, or a dataset you want to share/disseminate) audit the full subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the goal sharing product(s) (i.e. final study result product(s)/manuscipt(s) or dataset) (see step 1 above) starting with your goal data sharing product (i.e. manuscript, or a dataset you want to share/disseminate), systematically annotate either : all files/resources in this subset of study resources regardless of whether they will be shared in a public data repository ( \"wholistic\" annotation ) only the files/resources in this subset of study resources that will be shared in a public data repository ( \"minimal\" annotation ) once you've annotated all files/resources, add these resource annotation files to your resource tracker Advantages \"Top-down\" annotation allows for a narrower and more goal-focused approach to annotation and data-sharing as compared to the alternative \"As-you-go\" annotation; This approach may be very appealing to study groups that are well into their study as it reduces annotation and data sharing burden by focusing on producing the essential annotation needed to ensure that the results or datasets they share are discoverable, interpretable, reusable, and replicable by researchers and other potential collaborators. Concentrates annotation and data packaging work at the end of the study which allows singular focus on the task and may speed the process. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, you get the benefit of full local annotation of the files underlying your study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset), which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study. Even if you choose to use \"minimal\" annotation with the \"top down\" approach you still get the benefit of some local annotation to support preserving institutional knowledge within your study group. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, you maximize transparency and allow other researchers interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project and the data that explicitly underlies your study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) when accessing study documentation. Even if you choose to use \"minimal\" annotation with the \"top down\" approach you still provide a lot of transparency about what data and non-data supporting files you are sharing to support your study's goal data sharing product, how these files relate to each other and how to use and interpret these files; this presents a huge value to potential secondary data users or collaborators. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, this still allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility, interpretability and use of the study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by another researcher. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, this allows for documenting and sharing all metadata associated with the study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) and this can increase the discoverability of your study.

Caveats The \"as-you-go\" annotation approach, **when applied broadly as outlined above** is strongly recommended for study groups that are early on in their study as the burden of starting up is relatively light when few study files/resources have so far been collected or produced by or for the study. However, the start up burden of this approach may be quite substantial for studies groups that are late or even well into their study and have already accumulated many study files/resources, and we generally recommend these groups consider the alternative, more goal-focused and narrow annotation approach: [Top-down annotation](#top-down-annotation). **The \"as-you-go\" annotation approach may also be applied in a narrower sense**, especially by study groups that are later in their study and who will not apply the \"as-you-go\" annotation approach in the broadest sense. This implies that studies will consider the whole packaging overview process and complete items as they can, as opposed to waiting until the very end (for example, when they are about to submit a study manuscript for peer review) to start the process. Some examples include, 1) auditing study files for tabular data files, creating data dictionaries for existing tabular data files right away, and creating data dictionaries right away for new tabular data files as the study collects or produces them, 2) annotating final result products the study group knows will or likely will be included in a final manuscript as they are produced, and creating a results tracker for final manuscript documents as drafts begin to be forumulated by the study group, 3) annotating component experiments and other activities that are part of the study right away if already designed, or as soon as they are designed (especially if it is clear that the experiment or activity will or likely will produce data that will be used to support/produce final result products that will be included in a final manuscript).","title":"As-you-go annotation"},{"location":"terms/#top-down-annotation","text":"Top-down annotation implies that you will generally implement the data packaging and annotation process in a somewhat narrower, more goal-oriented manner as compared to how you would implement if using the alternative As-you-go annotation approach; You will generally determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation), then wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the final result product(s) or manuscripts containing a set of final result product(s) for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating); you will then audit and annotate the subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the results or dataset already created, and annotate this subset of study resources right away; when you take the \"top down\" annotation approach, you will generally audit the full subset of study resources required to support your result(s) and/or dataset regardless of whether these resources will ultimately be shared at a public data repository, however you may choose to 1) annotate all resources in this subset regardless of whether they will be shared in a public repository ( \"wholistic\" annotation ), or 2) annotate only the resources in this subset that will be shared in a public repository ( \"minimal\" annotation ) See the alternative: As-you-go Annotation As you move through the data packaging process steps , \"top-down\" annotation implies that you will : Audit relevant files start this right away : determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the final result product(s) or manuscripts containing a set of final result product(s) for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating) audit the full subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the goal sharing product(s) (i.e. final study result product(s)/manuscipt(s) or dataset) Organize and consistently name your files and folders start this right away : determine if you are early in your study if you are early in your study: consider using HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources to establish naming and organization conventions that should be followed for all study files, including for files that already exist and for new study files/resources as they are collected or produced align file name/organization of existing study files to the conventions you established in the step above -

Concentrates annotation and data packaging work at the end of the study which allows singular focus on the task and may speed the process.

Files that will not be shared are documented as permanent-private. This type of annotation works best paired with ['add as you go' annotation], as it easier an less time consuming to annotate wholistically, retrospectively, as part of ['top-down' annotation]. Although this mode of annotation is more time consuming, it maximizes transparency and allows investigators interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project when accessing study documentation on the Platform. This structure also allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by an investigator.

Study groups that are earlier in the process and are interested in understanding and implementing a file and folder structure that facilitates data sharing in the future.

In general, minimize the number of folders at each level, and the number of 'layers' of your whole directory. File naming conventions can often be used quite effectively to 'organize' files and to provide clues as to what the files are and how they relate to each other without resorting to using separation into different directories to serve that purpose. However, there is a limit to naming conventions, and you may want to separate your files into directors based on some type of logical groupings and/or based on th elevel or timing of access to the files you expect to provide. See below for further details. Reminder Before creating more directories or directory layers, consider whether file-naming conventions may be used more efficiently to create this organization. Create logical groupings \u00b6 There are a number of ways to group files logically. Below are some examples of how you can logically group your files in folder structures: Grouping strategy Examples By file category Raw data grouped together; processed data grouped together; protocols grouped together; data dictionaries grouped together By experimental subject All raw data files from a particular cell (across all protocols grouped together, etc.) By type of experiment All current clamp experiment files grouped together; all voltage clamp experiment files grouped together By experiment All raw data files mkdocsfrom a particular protocol, across all cells to which the protocol applies, grouped together By file type All CorelDraw figure files grouped together By expected use All files you expect a primary or secondary user of the data/metadata would want to use and/or cite together (as a package) - for example, grouping files that you expect you will want to provide different levels of access to/access restrictions for and/or that you want to provide access to with different timing. See below for more information on access level and timing. Consistently name your files and folders \u00b6 Universal conventions \u00b6 File and folder names should generally be informative/descriptive Wherever possible name your files and folders in a way that will let a human user reasonably infer quite a lot about what the file holds without any further information It is very helpful if file and folder names are all lower case Don't use spaces or special characters Preferred separator is a dash ('-'), e.g., my-data-file-1 Special conventions \u00b6 If you have multiple files or folders of the same type , choose a naming convention that's descriptive, and not unmanageably long, and be consistent. For example: One file per day, per cell, per protocol: Potential convention: \"day\"-YYYY-MM-DD-\"cell\"-[0-9]-\"protocol\"-{short-protocol-description} Example filename: day-2023-03-17-cell-3-protocol-200ms-pulse.asc One folder per experimental objective: Potential convention: {cell-type}-{short-experimental-approach-description}-{short-experimental-objective-description} Example foldrer name: drg-current-clamp-effect-of-K1395R-on-drg-neuronal-excitability; drg-voltage-clamp-biophysical-properties-of-K1395R If you have files that are related , choose a naming convention that's descriptive, and not unmanageably long, and be consistent. For example: A tabular/csv data file that has a data dictionary Potential convention: The data dictionary for a data file has the same filename as the data file, with a \"dd-\" prefix Example file name(s): Data file name : my-data-1.csv Corresponding data dictionary file name : dd-my-data-1.csv Several experiments that each have an experimental protocol Potential convention: The protocol of the experiment has the id of that experiment (from the experiment tracker) in the filename, with a \"protocol-\" prefix Example file name(s): Experiment id (from experiment tracker) : exp-1 Corresponding protocol file name : protocol-exp-1.txt","title":"Name"},{"location":"terms/name/#organize-study-related-files-into-folders-with-consistent-naming-conventions","text":"Organize all your files (whether you will share them or not), into folders.
